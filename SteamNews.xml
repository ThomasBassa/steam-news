Need a new challenge? Well, you&amp;#39;re in luck, because we are now introducing the Hard Mode for Amnesia: The Dark Descent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the Hard Mode? It is really just as the title suggests: a mode that makes it harder to beat the game. You know, in case it wasn’t stressful enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hard Mode has the following features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Autosaves are disabled, and manual saving costs 4 tinderboxes&lt;br /&gt;- Sanity dropping to zero results in death&lt;br /&gt;- Less oil and tinderboxes throughout the levels&lt;br /&gt;- Monsters are faster, spot the player more easily, deal more damage and stay around for longer&lt;br /&gt;- There is no danger music when the monsters are near.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary: the environments are harsher, the monsters more unforgiving, insanity is deadly, and death is final – unless you pay a toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pick between normal mode and Hard Mode when starting a new game of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The mode changes some fundamental elements of the game, and therefore can’t be changed halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beating the game on Hard Mode will earn you a new trophy called Masochist. Because, you know, you pretty much have to be one to complete the mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mode affects the Illuminatus achievement, which you can’t get during playing in Hard Mode as it reduces the amount of tinderboxes throughout the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be patching in the Mac and Linux versions next week.</description><author>FG_kira</author><guid>3167611029764521240</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:10:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The 25 best multiplayer games on PC</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/3167611029761231852</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Garry's Mod&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplayer games are the best type of games, because they&amp;#8217;re built around the most interesting components known to humans: humans. Men, women, and an awful lot of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet strangers aren&amp;#8217;t always the friendliest bunch, but they can surprise you in ways that a static system can&amp;#8217;t. People form the living, beating hearts of the gaming moments I value the most. Join me, then, as I point at the games that encase those beating hearts best.  &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/10/01/the-25-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc/#more-591467" class="more-link"&gt;&lt;span aria-label="Continue reading The 25 best multiplayer games on PC"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-241"&gt;FFF-241&lt;/a&gt; we discussed how the game delivers information to the player in a number of confused ways; Blinking arrows and circles, chat messages on the bottom left corner of the screen, objectives in the top left, orange modal boxes bubbles on top of the player, and so on. These problems are exacerbated on high resolution monitors, where the information becomes even further spread apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried a few ways to unify this information, but much of it was required to be in the world space, or needed to have a link between the screen space and the world space. The common solution to this is to have the GUI &amp;#39;point&amp;#39; to an entity in the game world, but we wanted something more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hello my name is: Compilatron&lt;/h2&gt;The idea for a robot sidekick in a video game is nothing new, but the solution fits to Factorio really well. When I arrived at the office and mentioned the concept, Albert immediately asked “Have you ever notice the forum &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;amp;u=7177"&gt;FactorioBot&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot; and proceeded to show me some concept renders for the robot. Alberts idea had been discussed several times before as a solution to this very problem, just waiting for the right time. Well, Compilatron your time is now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/28f5ad4d275837fe796c7c69d339ce36a65dee95.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Albert&amp;#39;s latest render of Compilatron, our companion character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Compilatron character allows us to couple text and positional data together, which creates a much tighter connection between the subject of the information and the information itself. Previously, the orange modal boxes and blinking arrows could be used in this way, as they could point to entities in the world. Compilatron can do this without breaking the immersion and game flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/2749bccb2c2f20ac39656b64da9c7084c1449e2f.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don’t want to reveal too much, but you can see that this is already better than the orange modal windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compilatron also gives us a hand with screen space information. If we can successfully style some of the user interface elements (such as the new &lt;em&gt;as-of-yet-unshown&lt;/em&gt; objective window) to match the Compilatron style, I believe we can create an even stronger association between text in the screen space and that in the world space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way the Compilatron helps us keep the immersion intact is as a plot agent. Currently campaign plot events just &amp;#39;happen&amp;#39; when objectives are completed, or when characters internal monologue decides the next move. Now we can have Compilatron act as a driving force to the campaign, it gives the objectives to the player, interacts with entities during cutscenes, and overall makes things less awkward than they are now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are two of the major benefits of having Compilatron, there are also some more interesting things we can do with it in the future, The specifics of how Compilatron will work and interact with the player are still in development, so expect some changes from what you see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I feel like the solution is working out, but not without some issues, the largest of which was working with the current Unit AI&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compilatron - Technical additions&lt;/h2&gt;I have been working on the technical side of Compilatron, which should be of interest to the modders among you. Compilatron is entirely scripted through Lua, it is not a custom C++ entity at all, which meant we needed to add a few things to our scripting API to make it possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, The Compilatron is a Unit, which means it is controlled in the same basic manner as the biters. As Units have never been used in the base game for anything but biters, there are quite a few unusual behaviours baked into the Unit control code, that didn&amp;#39;t really make sense outside the context of biters. To fix this without breaking the base game, I&amp;#39;ve been adding prototype flags to units which disable these special behaviours by default, and enabling them only on biters (e.g., trying to return to a spawner every now and again, which can mess up your current command execution). These are being fixed on an ad-hoc basis whenever we run into them, so if you&amp;#39;re a modder who&amp;#39;s had some pain with this kind of thing, please let us know what you&amp;#39;d like to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most significant change I&amp;#39;ve made is probably opening up the pathfinder to Lua script. This means that you can issue asynchronous pathfinding requests that are not associated with an actual command, useful for e.g., checking if you can path from one place to another. Later on, we will also include the ability to issue a move order and pass in the computed pathfinding data, which would let you modify paths before executing them, or even write your own totally custom pathfinding in Lua.&lt;br /&gt;As well as what&amp;#39;s mentioned above, there&amp;#39;s been a whole host of miscellaneous changes and additions, including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Script event on AI command completion, so you know when a Unit has completed its current command.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allowing units to pathfind through friendly buildings (i.e. walk over to it, destroy it, then continue over the place it used to stand). Only when explicitly requested, of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allowing units to path through and open friendly gates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added a whole bunch of flags to go_to_location commands, exposing pathfinder internals such a low priority pathfind requests, and prioritising straight paths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Units will now avoid pathing through all friendly entities, as opposed to the old behaviour of only avoiding same-force entities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added new AI command stop, and improved the wander command significantly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added a new HighlightBox entity, that will draw a selection box around a specified entity or at a specific position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added a speech bubble entity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow accessing Lua scripts by __MOD-NAME__/script.lua style path, so you can reference the same Lua scripts from multiple scenarios in one mod.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Klonan has already made a mod to help test and debug all the new modding commands, scripting, and API features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://eu1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-262-mod-example.mp4"&gt;https://eu1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-262-mod-example.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://eu1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-262-mod-example.webm"&gt;https://eu1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-262-mod-example.webm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;#39;re very interested in the benefits that these changes will bring modders &amp;quot;for free&amp;quot;, so if you&amp;#39;re an interested modder with some opinions/requests about this topic, let us know, we&amp;#39;ve started a specific forum thread for the topic &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/62717"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, let us know what you think on our &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/62718"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>3167611029750412211</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2018 16:28:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Amnesia: The Dark Descent is now haunted by Hard Mode</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/3167611029750422628</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the season of spooky celebrations kicking off, &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/amnesia-the-dark-descent/"&gt;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/a&gt; has added a Hard Mode for people who wish to suffer terrible cruelty as they explore the horrible ghost house of meat monsters. The new mode, added to 2010&amp;#8217;s first-person spooker in a patch today, makes the meatmen more murderous and starves us of comforting light so we lose our mind (and then die as we lose our loose grip on reality). So a real good time. It&amp;#8217;s a stark contrast to the bonus mode developers Frictional Games added to their later Soma &amp;#8211; an &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/12/01/soma-safe-mode-update-released/"&gt;easy option for explorers and sightseers&lt;/a&gt;. This time, they want you dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radioactive wasteland of any Fallout game is a dangerous place, and twice as deadly for those who go in early. Those who pre-ordered Bethesda&amp;#8217;s multiplayer spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/fallout-76/"&gt;Fallout 76&lt;/a&gt; on PC (or PS4), can dive into post-apocalyptic West Virginia on October 30th, two weeks ahead of its November 14th launch date. Expect bugs, server issues and occasional nuclear explosions &amp;#8211; par for any beta, really. Below, Fallout 76&amp;#8217;s intro doing double duty as a new trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stealthy murder game Mark of the Ninja is &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/mark-of-the-ninja-review/"&gt;really good&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;apos;s also getting up there in years. To address that, Klei announced back in March that a &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/superb-stealth-game-mark-of-the-ninja-is-getting-remastered/"&gt;remastered version&lt;/a&gt; was in the works and would be out later this year. Now we&amp;apos;ve got a more properly detailed look at what the updated version will deliver, and a release date of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klei/status/1044636639966912512"&gt;October 9&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new version of the game will include the Dosan&amp;apos;s Tale DLC that was released for the 2013 Special Edition of the game, which adds a new character, level, items, and developer commentary. The graphics have been updated to support 4K resolution, the soundtrack has been remixed and remastered in 5.1 audio, and an unlockable New Game+ mode will add &amp;quot;new challenges and rewards.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark of the Ninja: Remastered will go for $20 &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/214560/Mark_of_the_Ninja/"&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, although you can pick it up at a 15 percent discount if you pre-purchase on Steam. Owners of the base game can upgrade to the Remastered version, with the Special Edition DLC, for $5, and if you already own the special edition, the Remastered upgrade is free.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450412598620168433</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 22:25:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mark Of The Ninja: Remastered will be a cheap or free upgrade for original owners</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2450412598619265780</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Mark of the Ninja, Mark of the Ninja: Remastered&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klei Entertainment have announced that &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/mark-of-the-ninja-remastered/"&gt;Mark Of The Ninja: Remastered&lt;/a&gt;, the revamped rerelease of their rad stealth-o-murder-a-platformer from 2012, will launch on October 9th. It&amp;#8217;ll boast high-resolution art and improved sound but still be the same fine game at heart, and accordingly won&amp;#8217;t be expensive for folks who got Mark Of The Ninja on Steam the first time around. Klei &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klei/status/1044636639966912512"&gt;have said&lt;/a&gt; that those who got its Special Edition DLC back in the day, which cost   4/$5, will get Remastered for free. If not, hey, original players can just pay an extra   4/$5 now to get Remastered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Telltale Games employee has filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that the &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/former-telltale-developer-says-the-studio-was-hiring-new-workers-a-week-before-it-closed/"&gt;recent layoff&lt;/a&gt; of more than 250 employees without warning or severance is a violation of the WARN [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifcation] Act. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available via &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/25/17901106/telltale-layoffs-lawsuit-warn-act"&gt;Polygon&lt;/a&gt;, the lawsuit alleges that &amp;quot;the defendant violated the WARN act by failing to give the plaintiff and the class of similarly situated employees he seeks to represent at least 60 days advance written notice of termination, as required by the WARN Act.&amp;quot; That class, if approved by the court, will include approximately 275 employees, including those who were let go and the skeleton crew that remains employed at Telltale.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks &amp;quot;an amount equal to the sum of all of the Aggrieved Employees&amp;apos;: unpaid wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, accrued holiday pay, accrued vacation pay, pension and 401(k) contributions and other ERISA benefits, for sixty days following the member employee&amp;apos;s termination.&amp;quot; Interest, attorney&amp;apos;s fees, and &amp;quot;such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper,&amp;quot; are also requested.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WARN Act requires that companies of a certain size provide notice prior to layoffs, but the situation is complicated by exemptions, including &amp;quot;unforeseeable business circumstances,&amp;quot; for which Telltale may be eligible: &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/telltale-games-the-walking-dead-studio-closure-1202955309/"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt; reports that the end came very abruptly when a partner, rumored to be Lionsgates, suddenly backed out of its funding deal with Telltale, leading Telltale to cancel its Stranger Things deal with Netflix. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Telltale&amp;apos;s problem, as explained in this detailed breakdown of the situation at &lt;a href="https://gamedaily.biz/article/266/telltale-may-find-itself-in-legal-trouble-regarding-layoffs"&gt;GameDaily.biz&lt;/a&gt;, is that California has its own version of the WARN Act without a &amp;quot;unforeseeable business event&amp;quot; exemption. As Telltale is based in the state, it could find itself on the hook for penalties at the state level, even if it is exempted at the federal level.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that it&amp;apos;s a legally complex situation that doesn&amp;apos;t look particularly good for Telltale and will likely take a long time to untangle. The matter is complicated further by the fact that Telltale, despite its near-annihilation, is not technically closing yet: Telltale issued a statement yesterday saying that it is in talks with &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-is-working-with-multiple-potential-partners-to-finish-the-walking-dead-the-final-season/"&gt;multiple potential partners&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; about finishing The Walking Dead: The Final Season, and CEO Pete Hawley &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/petehawley/status/1043256818154143744"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, &amp;quot;To be clear, we&amp;apos;re not shutting down. As odd as that may sound, 25 of us will continue, foreseeable. I&amp;apos;ll make further comment in the coming weeks.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve reached out to Telltale for comment on the lawsuit, and to ask if a revival of The Walking Dead: The Final Season will enable the company&amp;apos;s former employees to be paid severance, and will update if I receive a reply.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965570804985</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:37:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This alternate ending to The Walking Dead Season One is now canon</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2450411965570616085</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do game developers do when they&amp;apos;re desperately bored? If the developer in question is Sean Ainsworth, a designer, writer, and artist on Telltale releases including Tales from the Borderlands, Minecraft: Story Mode, and &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-walking-dead/"&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/a&gt;, he makes an &amp;quot;alternate ending&amp;quot; to TWD Season One that we have decided is officially canon.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video, brought to our attention by former Telltale designer and director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ja2ke/status/1044624561528926208?s=21"&gt;Jake Rodkin&lt;/a&gt;, was created during the final days of work on The Walking Dead Season One. &amp;quot;The last week of production on Season 1, it was just me and @Spainsy left waiting for any last minute bugs,&amp;quot; Rodkin tweeted. &amp;quot;He made this during that stir crazy week.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ainsworth confirmed that he was responsible for it, calling it a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spainsy/status/1044627633059844097"&gt;weird, dumb thing&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, it&amp;apos;s pretty great, too. Is it actually canon? It was created by Telltale for a game built on the &amp;quot;choose your own adventure&amp;quot; design, and described by the designer and director on the project as an &amp;quot;alternate ending.&amp;quot; That&amp;apos;s good enough for me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Telltale remains in a dire, last-days state, and despite CEO Pete Hawley&amp;apos;s insistence that the studio is not closing down, it&amp;apos;s hard to foresee any other realistic outcome. We took a look at its legacy, and why it matters, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/why-telltale-mattered/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965570616085</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 17:15:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Seven years on, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is still a great immersive sim</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2450411965570540508</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of Human Revolution, I think of black and gold. Few big-budget games have such a distinctive look, but that&amp;#x2019;s part of what makes Eidos Montreal&amp;#x2019;s prequel so immediately striking. As a Deus Ex fan, I was sceptical when I heard a new game was in development. But then I saw those first screenshots, of a futuristic Detroit bathed in shades of black and gold, and knew the series was in good hands.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;That&amp;#x2019;s the first thing I said when I started on the project,&amp;#x201D; said art director Jonathan Jacques-Bellet&amp;#xEA;te when I interviewed him back in 2011. &amp;#x201C;I wanted the game to be very distinct. You see one screenshot and you know it&amp;#x2019;s Human Revolution. Art in games isn&amp;#x2019;t just about shaders, ambient occlusion, parallax mapping, or anything like that. It&amp;#x2019;s about ideas. And in that sense, the aesthetic is a crucial part of our game.&amp;#x201D;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in 2027, 25 years before the first game, the prequel begins with Adam Jensen, head of security for Sarif Industries, being critically wounded in a terrorist attack. On the brink of death, Jensen is saved by his boss, David Sarif, who reconstructs his body with experimental cybernetic augmentations. An upgrade he, famously, never asked for, but that gives him the power to hunt the people responsible down.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Jensen&amp;#x2019;s appeal is his gravelly voice and deadpan delivery, which come courtesy of actor Elias Toufexis. &amp;#x201C;They had a specific voice in mind,&amp;#x201D; he tells me. &amp;#x201C;If I remember correctly, they wanted a tribute to JC Denton from the original game and Clint Eastwood. In the sequel I had more say and was allowed to bring additional nuance and texture to the performance, but Jensen&amp;#x2019;s voice is essentially my normal voice.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unlikely hero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JC Denton was trained from an early age as a counter-terrorism agent and fitted with advanced, discrete nanoaugs, Jensen is thrust into the events of Human Revolution against his will, and his body is constantly fighting against his new implants. He, and other augmented humans in this dystopian world, need a steady supply of an expensive drug called Neuropozyne to prevent their bodies from rejecting the augmentations and killing them.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to that a general distrust of augmented people from so-called &amp;#x2018;naturals&amp;#x2019;, which boils over in the sequel, and life with cybernetic implants is often more trouble than it&amp;#x2019;s worth &amp;#x2013; even if you can punch through a concrete wall and run faster than a gazelle. Of course, for the player, Jensen&amp;#x2019;s augmentations are an incredible amount of fun to experiment with, and make for a wonderfully diverse immersive sim.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the stealth-conscious cyberpunk there&amp;#x2019;s the Glass-Shield Cloaking System, which lets you turn invisible for up to seven seconds when fully upgraded. You can also upgrade the Hermes Cybernetic Leg Prosthesis to jump to superhuman heights, opening up new ways to sneak into places. Stealth is the most satisfying way to play Human Revolution, with multiple paths through the sprawling levels and plenty of vents to squeeze through.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#x2019;d rather make a mess, you can upgrade your Cybernetic Arm Prosthesis to reduce weapon recoil and throw heavy objects at people. Or use the Typhoon Explosive System to turn yourself into a human grenade, unleashing a blast of lethal shrapnel, taking out multiple enemies at once, including security robots. It&amp;#x2019;s a hugely entertaining collection of powers, and combining them to create your own bespoke play style is an important part of what makes the game great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, really, it&amp;#x2019;s the world that draws me back to Human Revolution. It&amp;#x2019;s one of the most visually compelling visions of the future on PC, with a cluttered, lived-in feel that transcends the dated visuals. Both cities, Detroit and Hengsha, feel slightly claustrophobic and boxy by today&amp;#x2019;s standards, but the visual flourishes&amp;#x2014;particularly the neon billboards and that dramatic double-stacked metropolis&amp;#x2014;still look fantastic. It remains an incredibly atmospheric setting, weighted by Michael McCann&amp;#x2019;s moody, understated score and some richly immersive ambient sound design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted every object to have its own concept art and individual furniture sets for different offices. He could have turned me down right then and there, but at Eidos Montreal we believe this kind of detail is absolutely necessary to create a believable world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;I approached our producer, David Anfossi, early in preproduction and told him that I&amp;#x2019;d need to design like 1,400 props,&amp;#x201D; says Jacques-Bellet&amp;#xEA;te. &amp;#x201C;Anything from cool sci-fi machinery, a given for this kind of game, to coffee cups and keyboards. I wanted every object to have its own concept art and individual furniture sets for different offices. He could have turned me down right then and there, but at Eidos Montreal we believe this kind of detail is absolutely necessary to create a believable world. We had to invent a hundred brands and company names, as well as their logos, which is expensive to do, but really adds to the richness of the setting.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;There are very few designs where I just let the concept artist come up with something in their head,&amp;#x201D; he adds. &amp;#x201C;We were always looking at real-world designs for inspiration, because I wanted every object to have at least some basis in reality. Some people said it was too futuristic, while others said it wasn&amp;#x2019;t futuristic enough. But I read a lot of Ray Kurzweil (author of The Age of Intelligent Machines), and he thinks tech will be even more advanced than what we&amp;#x2019;ve portrayed.&amp;#x201D;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But which version should you play? The original release of Human Revolution caught deserved flack for its awful boss battles, which didn&amp;#x2019;t respect the player&amp;#x2019;s augmentation choices, forcing stealthy players into combat situations. &amp;#x201C;I&amp;#x2019;m a shooter guy and I&amp;#x2019;m coming into this not knowing a lot about Deus Ex,&amp;#x201D; said Grip Entertainment president Paul Kruszewski, the company the boss battles were outsourced to, in a revealing behind-the-scenes video.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the 2014 Director&amp;#x2019;s Cut, the boss battles were overhauled, giving you additional ways to beat them&amp;#x2014;including, importantly, stealth options. This version also includes the brilliant Missing Link DLC, AI improvements, and better lighting&amp;#x2014;although, for some reason, the divisive gold fi lter has been massively reduced, stripping away some of the game&amp;#x2019;s visual identity. If you can deal with that, the Director&amp;#x2019;s Cut is almost certainly the best way to play Human Revolution today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Script notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years on, this is still a great immersive sim, and well worth revisiting. The weak link is the writing and story. I love Jensen, which is probably more to do with Toufexis&amp;#x2019; performance than the actual script, but there&amp;#x2019;s something slightly cartoonish and unconvincing about his supporting cast. And the various parallels to contemporary society and culture have all the fi nesse of a drunk gorilla swinging a baseball bat&amp;#x2014;something Eidos Montreal doubled down on in the next game, Mankind Divided. That said, the story does provide a few memorable moments.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview this year with PCGamesN, David Anfossi admitted that while he considers Deus Ex the &amp;#x201C;brand of the studio&amp;#x201D;, no third game is currently in the works. &amp;#x201C;We&amp;#x2019;re a big studio with close to 500 people now, but at the same time we&amp;#x2019;re working on three other projects. When it&amp;#x2019;s time for Deus Ex, it&amp;#x2019;ll be time, and we&amp;#x2019;ll do it correctly.&amp;#x201D; So Deus Ex isn&amp;#x2019;t dead, but we might not play a new one for a while&amp;#x2014;which is as good an excuse as any to return to Detroit for another stint as Adam Jensen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965570540508</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 16:38:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Telltale mattered</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2450411965569746969</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden collapse of Telltale Games took most by surprise, including its own employees. In a snap of the finger, the storyteller became a shell of its former self, leaving fans in the lurch, its employees scrabbling for work on Twitter, and the last series of The Walking Dead apparently abandoned half-finished. At the time of writing there is little hope of us ever getting to finish Clementine&amp;#x2019;s story.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ignominious fate for an influential company. Telltale is one of the few studios to make episodic gaming work, and its adventure game template would go on to inspire many others, much as its own work was inspired by the hit adventures of LucasArts during its glory years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the success of games like The Walking Dead and the high-profile licenses that followed it&amp;#x2014;Minecraft, Batman and Game of Thrones in particular&amp;#x2014;it&amp;#x2019;s hard to remember that Telltale originally started as a very small fish in an admittedly relatively empty barrel. Adventure games weren&amp;#x2019;t dead&amp;#x2014;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-future-of-adventure-games/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;they never have been&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2014;but they were certainly on the outs after LucasArts canned planned games like Full Throttle 2 and Sam &amp;amp; Max 2 in the interests of making more terrible Star Wars prequel games.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telltale started out with a series based on the Bone comics and the basically forgotten CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder and Texas Hold&amp;#x2019;Em, but it was with Sam &amp;amp; Max that they really shot to the world&amp;#x2019;s attention. Former LucasArts staff, including names like Day of the Tentacle creator Dave Grossman, starting a whole new company devoted to adventures?&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could possibly go wrong?&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we know most of the answer. In public, Telltale&amp;#x2019;s output almost immediately suffered as relatively primitive technology was stretched to fit every new license into the same template. Early on, that was the &amp;#x2018;Three Trials&amp;#x2019; structure&amp;#x2014;intro, three objectives, ending, rinse, repeat. Behind the scenes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17130056/telltale-games-developer-layoffs-toxic-video-game-industry" target="_blank"&gt;reports of crunch and mismanagement&lt;/a&gt; tell a tale of a company over-stretching.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of The Walking Dead seemed to herald a new era for the company, in which games would finally be designed around licenses rather than shoved into a template. Sadly, the message the company took from the success was almost the opposite. Memorable elements like &amp;quot;X will remember that&amp;quot; went from a clever gimmick to a tired statement, and too often smoke-and-mirrors presentation hid a lack of real choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batman: The Enemy Within presented us with one of the most fascinating takes on The Joker ever committed to any kind of screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most frustrating part of this on the outside though was knowing just how much better they could have been. Telltale had incredible talent at its disposal, and it&amp;#x2019;s often overlooked by players and press just as much as it was internally. &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/901399/Sam__Max_The_Devils_Playhouse/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sam and Max: The Devil&amp;#x2019;s Playhouse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a superb attempt to break the formula, giving the Freelance Police a grittier world that regularly tried new things, like Sam&amp;#x2019;s noir-laced rampage and an episode where Max has to be the brains of the operation. &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back To The Future, a mostly forgettable series, still had thoughtful design that explored Doc&amp;#x2019;s past in a way that was both faithful and ambitious, with my favourite scene showing that even a Doc in charge of a dystopian city is still a Doc driven by compassion and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tales From The Borderlands was an amazing ride, while Batman: The Enemy Within presented us with one of the most fascinating takes on The Joker ever committed to any kind of screen. In what other series or medium would you be playing as Batman, offering Joker tips on romancing Harley Quinn? Never mind doing it while nursing the hope that, just maybe, you could steer him away from crime, even knowing that it&amp;#x2019;ll all end in tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Telltale. The music of Jared Emerson-Johnson, the design of people like Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman, the acting and writing and cinematography of a whole army of excellent people that frankly the company often didn&amp;apos;t deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#x2019;m not saying everything the Telltale touched turned to gold. It didn&amp;#x2019;t. Jurassic Park in particular is best forgotten. But as with every story, there&amp;#x2019;s nuance in the telling that deserves to be celebrated. I personally didn&amp;#x2019;t like Game of Thrones very much, but the opening chapter was majestic&amp;#x2014;in their most powerful moments, Telltale games put you you in the boots of characters making desperate choices. My favourite scene in The Walking Dead isn&amp;#x2019;t one of the big dramatic ones, but the simple decision of which hungry people to feed, and how it makes you wonder, just for a moment, what you would have done in their place.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They proved that adventures weren   t simply alive and well, but that they could reach a mainstream and hardcore audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#x2019;t many Telltale games where I can&amp;#x2019;t pick out at least a few fantastic moments. Even within the often suffocating templates, pre- and post-The Walking Dead, Telltale&amp;#x2019;s creative teams repeatedly pushed boundaries and experimented in ways that didn&amp;#x2019;t get enough credit. Batman, to give just one example, mined new ground by splitting the action between Batman and Bruce Wayne, with a particular focus on Wayne. The series skirted issues of good and evil and instead pressured you with horrible choices about who would get hurt as a result of your actions. The new series of The Walking Dead looked to be taking things in another interesting direction, somewhat like BioShock 2, by having your decisions primarily affect your ward, AJ, instead of the player-controlled Clementine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A lasting impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of Telltale on the wider market can&amp;#x2019;t be ignored. Telltale games showed that adventures have to be dramatic and exciting things, not staid, backward-staring affairs. Telltale games directly inspired Life Is Strange and Dreamfall Chapters, and former members went on to create the beloved Firewatch and the upcoming In The Valley Of Gods. More than anything else, Telltale proved that adventures weren&amp;#x2019;t simply alive and well, but that they could reach a mainstream and hardcore audience on any platform. They didn&amp;#x2019;t save adventure games, because adventures didn&amp;#x2019;t need saving, but they damn well gave them a much needed shot of adrenaline to the proverbial genre-buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the true legacy of Telltale deserves to be something else. Whatever its sins, and however poor many of its corporate decisions have been, we should remember it not as some anonymous gestalt, but for the work of an army of writers, artists, developers and more who cranked out often amazing stuff in very difficult situations. We can only hope that as many of them as possible find new positions in the games industry and continue to knock out those jams, hopefully in rather more comfort and on a less demanding schedule. There aren&amp;#x2019;t many companies that have touched so many people with their stories, and taken us on such exciting, funny, and occasionally heartbreaking adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will remember that.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965569746969</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 11:37:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Telltale is working with 'multiple potential partners' to finish The Walking Dead: The Final Season</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2450411965568046006</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all appearances, the closure of Telltale Games meant the end of the incomplete &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-walking-dead/"&gt;The Walking Dead: The Final Season&lt;/a&gt;. There was some faint hope among fans that the studio would be able to finish it, but Clementine voice actor &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/clementines-voice-actor-suggests-the-walking-dead-the-final-season-may-go-unfinished/"&gt;Melissa Hutchison&lt;/a&gt; and designers &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/former-telltale-developer-says-the-studio-was-hiring-new-workers-a-week-before-it-closed/"&gt;Emily Grace Buck&lt;/a&gt; and Michael Kirkbride both strongly suggested that it wouldn&amp;apos;t happen. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a tweet released ahead of tomorrow&amp;apos;s launch of TWD: The Final Episode chapter 2, however, Telltale suggested that it might still happen.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;apos;s a long way from carved in stone, but it&amp;apos;s more than fans had to hang onto a few hours ago. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s not surprising that other studios would be interested in the property: The Walking Dead is Telltale&amp;apos;s flagship series, and the studio&amp;apos;s collapse has focused attention on it. It won&amp;apos;t mitigate the damage wrought by Telltale&amp;apos;s sudden shutdown, but if someone like Paradox or THQ Nordic can pick it up, maybe bring on some of the original development team (at least temporarily), and deliver the balance of The Final Season, it will at least bring closure to the series that really put Telltale on the map.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965568046006</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 00:13:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Former Telltale developer says the studio was hiring new workers a week before it closed</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2450411965567466520</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden, shocking &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/major-layoffs-hit-telltale-games/"&gt;closure of Telltale Games&lt;/a&gt; last week was deeply disappointing for fans of its games, including The Wolf Among Us, Tales From the Borderlands, and The Walking Dead. That last one is a particularly stinging loss because &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-when-well-get-to-the-end-of-clementines-journey-in-the-walking-dead-the-final-season/"&gt;The Walking Dead: The Final Season&lt;/a&gt;, which would conclude Clementine&amp;apos;s narrative, just got underway in August and will almost certainly go unfinished.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But designer Emily Grace Buck, whose credits at Telltale include TWD: The Final Season, Batman, and Guardians of the Galaxy, posted a series of tweets after the closure was confirmed to remind everyone that the real damage runs much deeper. Roughly 250 Telltale employees were let go with no severance pay, she said, a figure slightly higher than initial counts, and many of them were contractors, meaning that they&amp;apos;re not eligible for unemployment. Their workplace health coverage, which is particularly vital in the US, will also be cut off just one week after the closure.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even uglier is that according to Buck, Telltale had new employees starting work at the studio just a week prior to the shutdown announcement, some of whom had relocated for their jobs. At least one former employee is a foreign national on a work visa, who will have to leave the US &amp;quot;within days&amp;quot; as a result of the closure.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Due to the insanely high cost of living in the Bay Area relative to payscale, many of my (unbelievably skilled and talented!!!) colleagues were living paycheck to paycheck and do not know what they are going to do to make ends meet this month,&amp;quot; she wrote.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buck also confirmed that the second season of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-wolf-among-us-season-2-and-telltales-walking-dead-finale-are-coming-next-year/"&gt;The Wolf Among Us&lt;/a&gt; is canceled, as is the &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-is-working-on-a-stranger-things-game/"&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/a&gt; project, although Netflix still wants to &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/following-telltale-layoffs-netflix-still-wants-to-make-a-stranger-things-game/"&gt;push ahead&lt;/a&gt; with that elsewhere. The second episode of The Walking Dead: The Final Season is expected to release on schedule, but there&amp;apos;s no real hope of it proceeding beyond that point: Melissa Hutchinson, who provides the voice of Clementine, suggested yesterday that the game &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/clementines-voice-actor-suggests-the-walking-dead-the-final-season-may-go-unfinished/"&gt;will not be finished&lt;/a&gt;, and former season lead designer Michael Kirkbride was somewhat more definite about it &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWalkingDeadGame/comments/9ic11c/on_the_neareve_of_episode_402_a_humble_request/?st=JMGOKEFU&amp;amp;sh=b651c6f5"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging fans to &amp;quot;at least give the [second] episode a try, even if it&amp;apos;ll be uniquely placed in the tragic history of Telltale&amp;apos;s efforts.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We know it&amp;#x2019;s weird, we know it sucks, we know it&amp;#x2019;s sad in ways that&amp;#x2019;s almost impossible to articulate, and we know it&amp;#x2019;s awful that we can&amp;#x2019;t tell you what would&amp;#x2019;ve happened after, but the episode is also just goddamn &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, and the best feeling we could have right now is to know it&amp;#x2019;s being played,&amp;quot; he wrote.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing Kirkbride&amp;apos;s statement about not being able to share Telltale&amp;apos;s plan for the remainder of The Final Season, Buck also shot down a suggestion that the script be shared online, so players can at least find out what happened. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965567466520</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:12:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Patch 1.9.1.10</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2450411965566751904</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Magicka&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Frictional &lt;a href="https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2018/09/what-is-amnesias-hard-mode.html" target="_blank"&gt;explained that&lt;/a&gt; that, as part of its work on the collection, it decided to "spice it up with a little treat".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can probably surmise, Hard Mode makes the already exhausting The Dark Descent more difficult by making a number of tweaks to the original's design. Autosaves are disabled, for instance, and you'll require four tinderboxes in order to perform a manual save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-21-horror-classic-amnesia-the-dark-descent-is-getting-an-official-hard-mode-next-week"&gt;Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965556218617</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2018 18:17:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Amnesia: The Dark Descent will be even harder from next week</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2450411965556037184</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frictional Games has announced that &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amnesia-the-dark-descent-review/" target="_blank"&gt;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/a&gt; will be getting a &amp;quot;hard mode&amp;quot; on September 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a move that&amp;apos;s a huge contrast to the Safe Mode, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/taming-somas-monsters-with-the-wuss-mode-mod/" target="_blank"&gt;introduced to Frictional&amp;apos;s SOMA&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of years ago, Amnesia will now be even more challenging. &lt;a href="https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2018/09/what-is-amnesias-hard-mode.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to Frictional&lt;/a&gt;, the new beefed up difficulty will make it &amp;quot;a little harder to beat the game.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes from the original difficulty mean autosaves will be disabled, manual saving will cost four tinderboxes, losing all sanity will result in death, and oil and tinderboxes will be more hard to come by.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that&amp;apos;s not enough to get you crying into your keyboard, monsters will be able to locate you more easily, they&amp;apos;ll be faster when they do, and are likely to make shorter work of you as their damage has also been increased. They&amp;apos;ll stick around for longer too, presumably to bask in your misery and/or death. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing the game on Hard mode will net you a sparkly, new trophy, aptly called &amp;apos;Masochist&amp;apos;. You&amp;apos;ll be able to choose between &amp;apos;normal&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;hard&amp;apos; mode when starting a new game but will be unable to switch part-way through, so choose carefully. &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2450411965556037184</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2018 16:34:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An update to Seal the Deal DLC is now available!</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2450411965555975036</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for A Hat in Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was jolly pleased when Frictional Games patched &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/12/01/soma-safe-mode-update-released/"&gt;a &amp;#8216;Safe Mode&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/soma/"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;, letting fraidypants like me freely explore the undersea horror. Conversely, I said &amp;#8220;Ha ha ha NOPE&amp;#8221; aloud after Frictional announced today that they will next add a new difficulty level to &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/amnesia-the-dark-descent/"&gt;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; a &amp;#8216;Hard Mode&amp;#8217; to freak your nut out and murder you hard. No thank you! But I know some Amnesia players had wanted their minds more fragile and its ghoulies deadlier, so good for them? Agh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;We have already pointed out, that we are trying to make a new campaign (&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-245"&gt;FFF-245&lt;/a&gt;), and part of it is the core beginning, the NPE/tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tutorial is one of the very critical parts of the game, as if the first 15 minutes of a game feels shitty, there is big chance, that the player will not play any further. I had this experience in many games myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the challenge could be articulated like this: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The current tutorial is okay, but can we make it great?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The approach in the current tutorial is to feed the player with the basic knowledge of how to control the basics of the game (the first mission and the start of the second mission) in the fastest way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/ca0c4c5840e0988f8ea6c1cb9622903912f79503.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The player is even given descriptive info like this, to diminish the chance of not understanding how the basic entities work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/ba6db1b366c12f038d2dc79418c2057a8086dbc8.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After few steps in the 2nd level, the player can start exploring his first self-feeding loop (make iron to make more iron).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/80d371d7eebd6238f701d2cc45f0835c24991491.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools used to this is mainly:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The message dialog that stops the game and explains the player various things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimization of the amount of things the player can interact with to absolute minimum, so he can&amp;#39;t start doing other things before the basics are clear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The possible drawbacks:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The constant interruptions can get really annoying (typically around 22 message dialogs before the player starts to play relatively freely in the 2nd level).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The possibility, that the player will mindlessly follow the step-by step tasks without understanding it, so he can become really lost later on, and the tutorial basically wouldn&amp;#39;t help him to understand things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So the question is: &lt;em&gt;Can we make a tutorial that makes these problems go away?&lt;/em&gt;, and alternatively, &lt;em&gt;How big are these problems actually?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current direction of the new tutorial attempt is to never use the message dialogs, so the player can learn the game more fluently, and to leave way more things to explore, as learning things yourself has a better chance of success than force-feeding generally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made a few tests of the new approach with a few people, the main takeaway, is that nothing is for free, and this approach created new drawbacks.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the player doesn&amp;#39;t figure out something basic, it can be &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; frustrating for him to figure out what is going on when not moving forward for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It might be possible, that some things are just not fun to learn by exploration, and it is more comfortable if they are force fed to you. I would compare this to a friend explaining you how to play a game for 5 minutes compared to 2 hours of trial and error.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more possible outcomes from this, and we shall see how different tweaks of both strategies work in the testings. It might be interesting if you mentioned your experience with the tutorial in the comment section as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Generic usability improvements&lt;/h2&gt;Regardless of the final tutorial approach we choose, we made some generic improvements that should help to avoid some of the pitfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interaction error messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People sometimes struggled (in the beginning), to figure out why they can&amp;#39;t interact with an object (open/mine/build, connect wires etc.) when it is too far away. We still keep the Beep Boop error sound and the different (yellowish) color, but we added a short flying text explaining the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-reach.mp4"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-reach.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-reach.webm"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-reach.webm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-wire.mp4"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-wire.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-wire.webm"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-wire.webm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also includes GUI related stuff like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-ingredients.mp4"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-ingredients.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-ingredients.webm"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-ingredients.webm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-hand.mp4"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-hand.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-hand.webm"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-hand.webm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-machine.mp4"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-machine.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-machine.webm"&gt;https://us1.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-261-not-machine.webm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these error had description messages, but these were in the bottom-left corner in the console, but we observed, that since it might quite far from the mouse and focus of the player, it can be easily missed. Even if it is not missed, it is not that comfortable to look somewhere &amp;quot;far away&amp;quot; for an error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlighting of inserter/miner related entities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When building/hovering an inserter, miner or any entity that inserter/miner can interact with, the corresponding entities are highlighted. This should help to understand the connection, and even for me, it is useful sometimes to see instantly, whether the inserter is one tile off or not when building it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/a4335841547605397deb941d638732a5357af674.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/ba689b6e4803441f4ed8577adb0c515bd4d48f2a.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Performance tweaking&lt;/h2&gt;Sometimes, I wondered why is the performance in Factorio is very unstable. The update runs fine (lets say 5ms) most of the time, and from time to time, it takes much longer (16+), so the frame is skipped, so the game feels choppy. For a long time, I expected, that this is caused by some Factorio tasks that can peak once in a while (train path finding), but the weird realisation came, when I played multiplayer, and I noticed, that other people didn&amp;#39;t have the problem, so I started to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized this long time ago when doing performance tests. Running any browser with modern (dynamic) page, or and browser related applications (slack for example) take more performance than you think. I could measure non-trivial increases in performance when I closed all these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows - performance options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Power options panel in windows (Control Panel → Hardware and Sound → Power options), you can select different power options. It mainly controls things like how long it takes before it goes to sleep, or when are the Hard disks stopped, but it contains more, notably the minimum processor state, which by default (in the default plan, is 5%):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/f9d960e5cf2d8b6a5d1573ea456f876965597fd4.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this settings, I am seeing performance similar to this on my test save&lt;br /&gt;Values are &lt;em&gt;avarage&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; in the context of the last 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/1ff20f1faa937d7a2227e33fa21967fd202ec7ef.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the default for high-performance is 100%:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/eb7bf35f05b69283cd13433cd75c507ce7d0b56d.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, I am getting this result:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/f5ee933460ec5344a04381b53426861bd8d03f65.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see, that the average time spent on update is roughly the same, but with the balanced mode, ther are quite big peaks of slowdowns that are happening regularly. You can test this yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;em&gt;minimum processor state&lt;/em&gt; basically allows the system to somehow slow down or turn off some parts of the processor. Factorio works in a way, that it does a lot of work in the update steps (the 5ms time), and then, the update thread has to wait until the time of the next update.&lt;br /&gt;My theory is that when the thread is waiting for the next update, the system thinks that it doesn&amp;#39;t need that much CPU power suddenly, so it slows down, but it doesn&amp;#39;t switch back to full power fast enough when it is needed again in the next update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be careful with this, as I can imagine that having this option all the time might not be that a good idea, mainly for laptops, but if your game starts to be choppy because of performance, it is worth a try to set this option for the time when you play Factorio at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The forums update - part 2&lt;/h2&gt;The new forum theme caused quite some debate &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/62457"&gt;on the forum&lt;/a&gt; and in the office this week, specifically about the limited content width, and the result is that we added a slightly modified theme to scale the forum to the whole screen width.

&lt;br /&gt;Hi Factorians,&lt;br /&gt;This is Dominik, and my first FFF post ever! I will use this opportunity to talk to you about the exciting subject of pipes. Yeah, I know, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spring came and with it Twinsen, saying &amp;quot;Pipes suck. Two people already tried to fix it and failed, who wants to be next?&amp;quot;, and I’m like &amp;quot;Hey, that’s just pipes, you just make a simple simulation, simple AF. I’m in.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;The conditions were even quite lenient:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluids get where they should.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They should act in a predictable manner, with reasonable splitting/joining in junctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluids can travel instantly, if need be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Respect the pipe throughput limitations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flow can be viewed on the pipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t do f**** up stuff like running in a circle indefinitely, sloshing back and forth endlessly etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should be faster/more UPS efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I am mostly working on the new GUIs, but still, the fact that summer is over and pipes are not done, kinda shows how simple fixing them is. Very naive I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Problems with the current system&lt;/h2&gt;There are couple mishaps in the current pipe system. Good thing is that they work - the fluids do get from A to B, in most cases anyway. It follows a simple elevation model, fluidboxes will try to equalise with their neighbours, which is quite fast to evaluate and solves the simple cases, but it does not address much outside of running through a straight pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/0e3e1727785f839892cf12a910649e4388284f58.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Green column represents volume, Blue represents flow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first of three main issues is that in junctions it behaves in a very random fashion. As a result, you might get recipients that are not getting any fluid where they obviously should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/f4e21f5ef0613348fb0a9db5fd490f2d9b372aa1.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue players voice is the limited behavior of the elevation functions. Only a fraction of the fluid is moved to its neighbour, so you rarely have a tank that is entirely full or entirely empty, which is a problem when you try to mix that with the integer based circuit network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third issue is performance. Even though the formulas are simple, they are calculated for every connection in every fluidbox, which adds up. As a result, nuclear power is unfeasible for megabases. There are other problems too, such as throughput loss over distance, fluids moving faster or slower depending on the entity update order, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/495b510a72c1e9f4592e5fe63ce27cbe2c710d95.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Fluid flows much quicker in the bottom pipe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My simulator&lt;/h2&gt;The game is not at all practical for testing and debugging pipes, so I built a simple command line pipe simulator to develop the new system in. As I was attacking what I thought to be a simple problem, I started simple, and then had to refactor it several times whenever I realized that the problem is harder than what my simulator can support. I will shortly describe how it works, before going to the model itself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pipe layouts are loaded from a text file such as “5 1 \n s p p d 0”, which is 2 dimensions of the system, followed by a 2d layout, in this case just one row source-pipe-pipe-drain-empty. The simulator loads the layout, connects pipes and then updates the system tick by tick on request. I get a very rough overview, as picture below, but most of the time I have to inspect the running code to see what is going on under the hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/43297552b00c8736a641bd2040b53be76541ea8a.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though now with the new map editor and the ability to step through single ticks, it will be much easier to test in-game too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Possible solutions&lt;/h2&gt;Before going to the current, simulation based model, I will shortly discuss other approaches that we have rejected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimizing the current system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something Harkonnen tried a long time ago, to reduce indirection in the update of the fluidboxes. Essentially, instead of each entity updating their own fluidbox, all fluidboxes in a segment would be kept in a singular part of memory, and then the simulation could be updated much faster. Initial experiments showed a performance increase of 30-50% updating all fluidboxes. However this would not address any of the other issues, and would add a significant amount of complexity to the currently quite simple handling of the fluidboxes, which we decided isn&amp;#39;t worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flow model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we are doing flow here, flow algorithms look like a candidate. The most naive &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm"&gt;Ford–Fulkerson method&lt;/a&gt;, although theoretically infinite, could work super fast in our case. Problem is that it only finds the maximum flow - the top limit of what we can push through. We could then divide this max fluid flow between the consumers and kinda get a working results. But the behaviour on the way would be ridiculous with full flow through one pipe and 0 through next, 0 to dead ends etc. In other words, the junction behavior would be entirely broken. Better balanced flow algorithms exist but these also don’t do exactly what we need and the complexity quickly jumps to astronomical realms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric network model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another proposal was modelling like an electric network. Fluid flow is a popular analogy to their workings, and they do have a lot in common. The great thing about them is that they precisely model the flow branching and it could work out of the box. What it does not allow though is to limit the flow - one wire can, theoretically, run any current, but not so for the pipes, and we don’t want one pipe to be enough to supply whole factory. The limitations could be added, but that would, again, kill it with complexity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simplified version of this is what we consider the &amp;#39;nuclear option&amp;#39;. In short, fluid network and pipes would work like the current electric network, instant transmission from production to consumption. This would increase performance by orders of magnitude, and remove the unintuitive flow of the current system, all consumers would get an equal split of the production, and storage tanks would act like accumulators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However we have decided not to pursue this, for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There would be no visualisation or indication of the flow of fluid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There would be unlimited throughput, one water pipe could supply all boiler and reactor setups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It abstracts away part of the realism and charm of the game. (While this is subjective at best, it does mean something to us.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merging fluidboxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would mean merging all the similar pipes in a segment into only a single fluidbox that needs updating. This would solve the performance issues, and the throughput loss over distance, however on its own, it would not solve the issues with update order, unintuitive flow direction/splitting etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the basic physics model, I ended up with something that is not at all realistic, but works well in practice. At the beginning, I tried to do almost realistic physics - as a proof of concept, with momentums and all that. But quickly I became cluttered with complicated formulas and it did not work at all. The system is so heavily discrete that physics are not really applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Factorio, a full content of a ~meter long pipe moves into the next pipe in one tick and instead of mixing single molecules in a junction all in real time (infinitely little steps) we have to mix/split huge blocks in one shot. It’s more like moving Lego blocks than running fluids. For a long time I was playing with pressure but I dropped even that in favour of just two variables - volume and speed, where the speed kinda models the pressure as well. Volume is the amount of fluid in the segment, speed affects how much of it wants to move on in a tick - as speed x volume. Just this is enough to provide a pretty decent simulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junction model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most difficulties come from modelling the junctions. The general problem is that when anything does not behave entirely correctly, there exists a situation where it creates a total breakdown, such as no flow into some pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are colliding forces in play. We can only evaluate one pipe connection (one inlet/outlet) at a time, but the behavior needs to be symmetrical and fair towards pipes that are to be evaluated later (currently it is not). What is the right order of evaluation and how to make it symmetrical without super complex look-ahead? &lt;br /&gt;Well, another big consideration is accuracy vs. complexity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over many iterations I kept developing models, followed by counterexamples that killed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My model and improvements&lt;/h2&gt;The evaluation model I have arrived to works with two passes through the pipes in one tick. The formulas are more complex than the current one so it should be slower, but there will be one improvement to counterbalance it. The rough algorithm in one tick is as follows (I omit many necessary but boring details):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Done at the end of previous step) Every pipe states how much fluid it intends to send to neighbours (called flow reservation) using a simple heuristic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform topological sorting by direction of reservations from 0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluate pipes in the opposite direction, i.e. from end to start, against the expected flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Update a pipe in two stages:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move fluid in it to neighbours proportionally to the space in them, space allocation they gave to the current pipe (providing they were already evaluated), and previous tick flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allocate the resulting free space to neighbours that are yet to be evaluated to ensure they get fair share of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go through the pipes again and do clean-up and calculate reservations for the next tick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So in this algorithm, we go from the last pipe, always moving fluid and making space for the next one. The reservations/allocations system ensures good behavior in the junctions. Essentially at every junction, the fluid will try to be split evenly between all the possible connections, which makes things very intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works nicely, but unfortunately this system is even more computationally demanding. Here comes in the key improvement which is taking every straight pipe (every segment that has max two connections) and connect it into one piece. No matter how long it is, it will be evaluated in one calculation. Naturally, this loses some realism, but it is insignificant as it is the junctions that matter and those will remain unaffected. So as long as you don’t do crazy stuff like making pipe grids and keep your pipes straight, they will have zero effect on UPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it more simply, updates will only be run on junctions and segments. At each junction, fluid will be split evenly among the neighbouring segments and junctions, any excess from one neighbour will spill evenly to the others. A segment is just a section of pipe without any splits, and fluid will transfer instantly through segments, but with a limited throughput.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/0a98f8a84cc7557efaaa314afdfbec2a0ad5195a.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the setup above, we would go from updating 32 individual pipes with the &amp;#39;old&amp;#39; system, to updating 3 junctions (blue) and 8 segments. Since a segment can be any length, overall we expect a big performance increase. It could also lead to more UPS efficient designs, trying to minimize the number of splits in your pipe network, we know some players really enjoy trying to optimize for different metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A last convenience improvement are some rounding mechanisms to fill or move away those 0.0001 fluids, draining the last drops from the pipe system if the sources are disconnected, and filling all the way up if production is greater than consumption. Another point left to consider is how to solve accidentally connecting pipes and tainting your whole oil system with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current state and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;All this is nice and already working, but still in the stage of the simulator.&lt;br /&gt;What I still need to do to get it to 0.17:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out good model for storage tanks, and how they fit in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps refactor it from floats to integers, which would make it work more cleanly, but would also make some calculations more complicated. TBD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finish the algorithm for correctly drawing the flow direction in the connected straight pipes (not that simple).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move it all into the game code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write tests for it (I am probably overreacting but I feel that this will take as long as all the work up to this point).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So to sum up, we have had this on our minds for a long time now, and performance was not the only issue we have considered. The new system will hopefully address all the issues we mentioned at the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, let us know what you think on our &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/62489"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, speaking of the forum, you might notice that it underwent some changes this week.  Sanqui has updated our forum from phpBB version 3.0 to 3.2, which is a bigger jump than it sounds. It brings us more in line modern web features, the forums are now usable on phones, it heightens security, and paves the way for future extensions. Some style changes are final, but if you have any particular gripes, please say so and we will try to accommodate everybody.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2454914931402563646</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 13:10:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Hat In Time s new DLC is free today and turns up the heat on an arctic cruise</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2454914931399877529</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for A Hat in Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It   s pretty obvious that the excellent Exapunks is a game about hacking. Specifically, it   s a game about programming viruses and sending them into networked systems to monkey around with data, set in a great alternative 90s Wired cyberworld of PC cases flashed with black and red decals and zines set in Apple Garamond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its makers, though, Exapunks is a game about limitations. Its format is the result of hard decisions about how much space you get to write your code in, how much freedom you get to solve its puzzles, and how it   s presented on your screen. And even now, creative director Zach Barth isn   t totally sure he and his team got it right.  &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/12/how-exapunks-represents-hacking-without-limits/#more-589461" class="more-link"&gt;&lt;span aria-label="Continue reading How Exapunks represents hacking without limits"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though objectively not nearly as good as Metal Gear Solid 2 or 3 (fight me), the fifth and final Kojima entry in the Metal Gear Solid series, The Phantom Pain, and its brief but excellent predecessor, Ground Zeroes, are cracking games. Right now, they&amp;#x2019;re also extremely cheap.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metal Gear Solid 5: The Definitive Experience collects both games and more DLC than you could probably be bothered to buy individually in one package.

&lt;h2&gt;Scan-codes vs Key-codes&lt;/h2&gt;While migrating from Allegro to SDL, HanziQ and Jiri replaced the keystroke handling from using key-codes to scan-codes.

You probably won’t care, unless you live outside of USA and/or you use a non-US keyboard layout. In short, key-code is a key identifier dependant on the symbol the key will output when pressed, scan-code is a key identifier based on the physical location of a key. So for example players with French keyboard layout (AZERTY) have to jump to the control options after launching the game for the first time, and remap movement from WASD to ZQSD, in order to be able to move their character without hurting their hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/0cc2f33d0b989dc43b659a2d1cd89683d2ad579d.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 0.17, the controls will map to the correct keys by default, regardless of your layout, and stay mapped to those physical keys even if you for some reason change your keyboard layout while the game is running. The disadvantage is, most of the non-US layouts didn’t end up with completely broken controls, so people kept playing with them and got used to them. So they’ll need to get used to the layout the game was originally designed with, or manually configure controls back to what they are used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, there is a catch&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago we have announced new &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-255"&gt;construction tools&lt;/a&gt;, which are by default bound to quite universal shortcuts (Ctrl+C for copy, Ctrl+X for cut and Ctrl+Z for undo). Bilka pointed out that the German keyboard has Z swapped with Y (as does the Czech one, but developers often don&amp;#39;t use it) and undo incorrectly defaults to Ctrl+Y instead. To fix these kind of shortcuts we determine the appropriate default scan-codes at start-up, so that undo is always Ctrl+Z, regardless of your layout, but the action will stay bound to those keys if you change keyboard layout at runtime, which is hopefully a reasonable compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We might do it for other controls too (it feels natural for M to always be the default key to open the map, and T to open the technology screen), but there is another catch. It is completely reasonable for player to walk north, and Ctrl+click some entities. Remember AZERTY keyboard? Player keeps Z pressed down to walk north and presses Ctrl to start control clicking. Well, I tested this and it doesn’t trigger undo, but still stops player from walking. So it is not completely destructive, rather annoying. I am not sure how or if we’ll solve this, perhaps people with these layouts that create these kind of collisions will need resolve them by changing controls options manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stable prototype IDs&lt;/h2&gt;The new Map Editor is finished, with one of the last things completed being importing surfaces from other save files. Importing surfaces from one save into another turned out to be quite complex, but not for the reasons you might think. The copying of a surface to a new surface is relatively easy, the main problem came from how we store map data in a save file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factorio internally makes lists of every entity, item, decorative and so on at startup and generates a mapping of the text name to an integer ID. This is internally called an ID mapping, and provides several benefits both runtime and when it comes to saving/loading the game. The main benefit being: we (and modders) don&amp;#39;t need to track and manually assign ids to everything added to the game - the engine does it all automatically. Anyone familiar with modded Minecraft before version 1.7 can attest to how much of a pain manually handling IDs can be and how easily it can break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because things can be added and removed due to our internal changes or by adding/removing/changing mods, the ID mapping often changes. Because it can change we have to include it in the save file to know what it was when the save was created. When Factorio saves the map one of the first things that&amp;#39;s written to the save file is that ID mapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way it worked before was: at load time - the game would attempt to restore whatever the ID mapping was for the save it&amp;#39;s loading. Anything it can&amp;#39;t find means that thing doesn&amp;#39;t exist any more, and anything new is stuff added. This lead to saves having different ID mappings for the same set of mods depending on the steps taken to make that save file. This worked for the most part but had a few small problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any time something was removed it was signalled by setting the ID at that location in the mapping to 0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The removed IDs couldn&amp;#39;t be re-used until the save was fully loaded, saved, and loaded again (leading to gaps in the IDs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different save files could end up using different IDs even when using the same set of mods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/3b2cf123797c32bf05ca20f817e3133216260a88.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new Map Editor wanting to take any save file and import it into your running game the fact that the ID mapping could be different was a problem. To add to the complexity we also have a migration system in place that lets you tell the game &amp;quot;I want to change all entities/items/&amp;#8230; named *A* into *B*&amp;quot;. This migration system also works when you remove the source otherwise it wouldn&amp;#39;t be that useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several false starts (a common theme when it comes to these complex reworkings), I came up with the following simple requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IDs will get assigned once after loading mods - after that they are never allowed to change for the lifetime of the program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a map is loaded instead of restoring the ID mapping it was using it will create a migration from the old ID to the new ID (if it still exists)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tracking of what was removed is done through a different system instead of treating a &amp;#39;0&amp;#39; ID as a removed ID.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/cc63f5a52c3b0b553888236e4784b48075e2a0a4.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this rework I discovered we were doing a bunch of extra work (some of it even causing bugs) just to restore the save file ID mapping, and I was able to simply delete all of it now that the IDs simply migrate to the correct values any time a save file is loaded. I even inadvertently fixed a bug someone reported related to crashing when loading a specific scenario-using save file due to this rework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the system is simpler now and doesn&amp;#39;t have any of the &amp;#39;quirks&amp;#39; it used to. The new Map Editor can import any save file the game is capable of loading and it all &amp;#39;just works&amp;#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HR worms&lt;/h2&gt;As you might know already from an &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-252"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, we are working with Ernestas on the high-res version of the enemies. This is a great excuse for also refining the concept of them. This week we want to show the new look of the worms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/f91e68a7e72bfd5669843edf61d05bf62e2bada1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intention is to keep what we had in the previous version, but to emphasize its personality and behaviour. This new version tries to be more aggressive, powerful and disgusting, while also acting more nervous and agitated. The &amp;quot;fingers&amp;quot; on its head are for digging tunnels, something that wasn&amp;#39;t really explained before, and which will also help to express the character of the worm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we are working on the animations, trying to emphasize these concepts, basically the worm is a creature of pure hate and killer instinct. Together with the sound effects, I hope it is going to be a pleasure killing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, let us know what you think on our &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/62414"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2447032995769235579</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 12:06:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Shakedown: Hawaii Teaser Trailer</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2447032995767157438</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Retro City Rampage™ DX&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's part of the company's ongoing response to complaints around some of the games Steam sells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in June, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-06-valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam"&gt;Valve backed away from policing the games it sold via Steam&lt;/a&gt; in favour of "allow[ing] everything onto the Steam Store", unless deemed illegal or "straight up trolling". That decision came following &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-25-valve-steam-school-shooting-game"&gt;the outcry around Active Shooter, a game which let you shoot kids in a school&lt;/a&gt;. The game was eventually removed from Steam after public outcry - but only on the grounds it was made by a "troll" developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did our best to ensure you can safely ignore swaths of games in the store, but still find them if you look directly via the search tool," Valve wrote in a new &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-06-steam-adds-more-options-so-you-can-hide-controversial-games"&gt;Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2447032995765744211</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 12:55:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>City-scale cyberstrategy game Frozen Synapse 2 launches and executes next week</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2447032995763034335</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Frozen Synapse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there&amp;#8217;s something to all these tactics games. They&amp;#8217;re sneaky &amp;#8211; you blink, and you&amp;#8217;re flanked with nowhere to hide. Today&amp;#8217;s second surprise announcement in the genre is that &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/frozen-synapse-2/"&gt;Frozen Synapse 2&lt;/a&gt;  launches next week on Thursday, September 13th. Jack me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frozen Synapse 2 is a vastly more ambitious beast than its &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/frozen-synapse/"&gt;purely tactical predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. Developer Mode 7 have taken the tense turn-based combat of the first game and transplanted it into a dynamic campaign set across a procedurally generated city. Check out the new trailer below, giving a tantalising peek at its glowing neon world erupting into flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://unknownworlds.com/ns2/files/2018/09/catalyst-324.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 324 is the start of something exciting! It’s the catalyst to our new development cycle! Over the last few years we have made changes and fixes to further develop NS2 with the emphasis on helping to stabilize the gameplay and create the best experience possible for every player. Today we start the sale of our limited time DLC the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://naturalselection2.com/catalyst"&gt;Catalyst Pack!&lt;/a&gt; This premium DLC offers the single largest skin pack we have ever released and it also includes future custom skins and items as a thank you for purchasing the DLC now. Sales of this DLC directly affect the budget for our development team and will help us to continue to bring you more exciting updates to the game. See more at &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.naturalselection2.com/catalyst"&gt;naturalselection2.com/catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, but hurry because this DLC will only be available for a short time and then it will be locked away in the UWE vault forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have spent the last few months working behind the scenes to develop a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/b/njrpasjl/ns2-roadmap"&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for our vision of NS2 2.0. This isn’t a new game, but what we feel is the ultimate version of NS2. Once our objectives on the roadmap have been completed, we will work with our partners to do a large marketing push and even test some free to play options to get NS2 in the hands of those who haven’t had the opportunity to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While our focus is shifting towards new and exciting changes, we will still continue to fight for more performance both server-side and client-side. We are fortunate to have so many community contributors who are helping on both fronts. We’re excited and passionate about supporting their efforts and we can’t wait to see their work included with a future release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With our push to both increase development productivity and shorten the time we can release this roadmap to you, we have hired an additional programmer. Not a stranger to NS2, please welcome Brian “Samoose” to the team! Over the years Samoose has been a big part of work done with our old customize menu and he has done lots of tinkering around the entire game. With his addition to the team, we hope to accomplish a lot of our tasks in a shorter amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thank you for your continued support&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on the battlefield!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fade    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased the size of the Fade’s hitbox slightly        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In recent months, feedback from the community has illustrated that the Fade can feel a bit too vulnerable or “squishy”, leading to aversion from average players in choosing the crucial lifeform. In lieu of adjusting its eHP values, we decided to refine the hitbox to make it closer to the actual model, making it slightly harder to hit for inaccurate shots. We’ll be monitoring this change closely.   &lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://unknownworlds.com/ns2/files/2018/09/fade-box324.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                      &lt;li&gt;Gorge Tunnel    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added a new unique building sound that can be heard beyond the Gorge Healspray distance. (Thanks Sweets!)        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This allows attentive Marines the chance to counter and contend aggressively positioned tunnels that are placed a full room away, but it should not heavily impact defensively placed tunnels that are predictable (such as Nanogrid). This has allowed us to lower the build time.&lt;/li&gt;                    &lt;li&gt;Lowered build time to ~8.5 seconds (from 12, was previously 5).        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We received a lot of unhappy feedback regarding the longer build times, which were originally intended to provide time for Marines to discover them when laning. However, utilizing sounds should allow us to lessen this build time while accomplishing similar goals.&lt;/li&gt;                    &lt;li&gt;Added a new unique idle sound that can only be heard just beyond melee range by both teams (Thanks Sweets!)        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This should aid both Aliens and Marines locating the tunnel in cramped and busy structure environments, especially when shaded. Aliens can no longer utilize silence to conceal a tunnel from a nearby Marine.&lt;/li&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                    &lt;li&gt;Removed the Tunnel cysts (“muffins”) inside the tunnel        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These obstructions were originally intended to provide brief cover for Aliens traversing inside, but after years worth of experience, it is clear that they more often obstruct Alien movement instead. Commence Gorge bellyslide halfpipe stunts!&lt;/li&gt;                      &lt;li&gt;Webs: (Thanks Katzenfleisch!)    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can now place Clogs on Webs.        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This allows for some creative Clog placement rather than simple Clog towers, and while it can better obstruct Marine movement it often provides a greater LOS for the Marine to shoot through.&lt;/li&gt;          &lt;li&gt;You can place 3 Clogs on a web. Any more than this will break the web and your clogs will fall. Hydras and Babbler Eggs on the underside of these Clogs will be destroyed when a Clog falls, so be wary of their placement!&lt;/li&gt;          &lt;li&gt;You can utilize this mechanic to get to previously hard to reach positions.&lt;/li&gt;                    &lt;li&gt;Webs are no longer destroyed on contact by Marines. Only Exosuits remove them on contact.        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was done to both accommodate Clogs on Webs (otherwise a single Marine can just run through your creation to destroy it) as well as provide a much needed increase in utility to the carefully placed Webs. As such..&lt;/li&gt;                    &lt;li&gt;Webs can be destroyed by the Axe        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It takes 4 swings to destroy a web with no weapons upgrade, 3 swings at any other level. So better get a welder if you’re in a hurry!&lt;/li&gt;                      &lt;li&gt;Babblers    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They will now reattach when a player evolves, even to another lifeform. They will also reattach to a player after leaving the Hive. (Thanks, Katzenfleisch!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweaks / Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added the first batch of skins for the Catalyst DLC:    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toxin skins for all playable Kharra lifeforms.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Sandstorm skins for all Frontiersmen equipment including for the first time the Grenade Launcher and Welder.&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Optimized the Marine droppable Catalyst Pack and Onos Boneshield effect shaders (Thanks Handschuh)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Players now lose their rookie status at Hive Level 15&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound Effects / General Audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Thanks Sweets!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marine footstep distance for Aliens have been slightly increased to 12 (from 11)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Increased Jetpack looping sound at mid-distance. Jetpack looping sound now louder than the burst sound.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Gorge Tunnel ambient sounds now play everywhere inside the tunnel and are much more audible.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Hive pain sound no longer plays for the Marine Commander at full volume across the other side of a map. Volume rolloff dependenton how close the camera is to the hive.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Optimized sound banks including 150 sounds. Many critical sounds that are very short but needed to be played immediately were inefficiently being streamed from disk which created a small delay. Other Voice Overs and music tracks which are larger files are no longer loaded into memory. This will help players the most who are still using mechanical HDDs and it slightly lowers overall memory usage for all players.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Axe impact sound on organic materials (Lifeforms, structures, infestation) is no longer delayed.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;FEV and FSB files are now part of the default consistency checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed Commander droppables not “snapping” to the target entity (such as an empty RT node or a Marine receiving a medpack) as intended.    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The placement model flickering on and off unreliably was also fixed&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Fixed that the lua garbage collector did not run while the renderer is finalizing the frame frame but afterwards. Additionally we made sure it doesn’t run longer than absolutely necessary every frame to decrease the time spent only collecting garbage every frame. This decreases the time spent to generate each frame for at least 0.5 ms.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that almost all sound and visual effects were networked and thus shown to the enemy commander even if they didn’t have any line of sight (LOS) to them. All known LOS issues have now been resolved except for the following:    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gorge Tunnel, Phase Gate, and Beaconing may still show the enemy transition to their new location on the map momentarily if LOS is achieved first.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Bonewall (from spectator only)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Webs remain (after gaining LOS at least once)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Fixed issue where gorge web placement model would persist after an invalid placement attempt.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that beaconing cared more about proximity to the command chair than room location. (Thanks, Katzen!)    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, on Descent, a marine in Receiving would not get beaconed to Hydroanalysis&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Fixed that you couldn’t drop a hive while hovering directly over the techpoint with your mouse.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that you could Echo upgrade chambers on top of Hive tendrils&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that embryos appeared on the minimap using a different icon than eggs if they were your friends on steam, allowing marines to easily distinguish between eggs and evolving players.    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NOTE: Despite the obvious balance implications of this change, this has been classified as a bug, and has been fixed.  The rationale behind it is that eggs and embryos appear identical in the world, therefore they should appear identical on the minimap.  The minimap should not be capable of providing more information to the team than they could collectively gather from in-world visuals alone.  In the future, the embryo world-model may be altered to appear different than the egg model, in which case the embryo minimap icon can be reinstated.&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Fixed that using the bait ball inside a gorge tunnel caused all babblers to be destroyed.  (Thanks, Katzen!)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that babblers did not reattach after leaving a hive.  (Thanks, Katzen!)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that too many babblers could stop khammanders from dropping a structure.  (Thanks, Katzen!)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that the team’s skill tier was often off due to using incorrect player values.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that the server’s skill tier didn’t correctly account for bots and added a tooltip for the icons in the server browser.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that running the performance profiler crashed the application when a worker thread got interrupted by the operating system. However there are still some other less commonly known cases where using the profiler can crash the application.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that firing a shotgun into infestation (or anything that plays the “materials/organic/ricochet” sound event) caused a massive hitch.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that you could place Cysts on floors below gratings/stairs, despite collision geo inbetween, and floors being set to “commandernobuild.”  (Thanks, Katzen!)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that you could not open the Server console on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012 or higher.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed starting a server on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012 or higher would result in an immediate crash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biodome    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue with visible Seasonal items in the Ready Room (Thanks, Zavaro!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed z-fighting textures near Join Team entities (Thanks, Zavaro!)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Caged    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed a hole in Purification (Thanks, Zavaro!)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Derelict    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue with cysts stuck under the stairs in Western Entrance (Thanks, Kash!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed hole in ceiling in Lookout (Thanks, Zavaro!)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Kodiak    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Command window visually and added additional Occlusion Geometry (Thanks, Loki!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Added preplaced IPs in Marine Start (Thanks, Psyk!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed Marine Start hologram (Thanks, Loki!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed fullbright Hangar when power goes out (Thanks, Psyk!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Improved Occlusion Geometry and performance (Thanks, Psyk!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Improved and brightened lighting (Thanks, Psyk!)&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed an area where structures are unpowered in Command (Thanks, Zavaro!)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Mineshaft (Thanks, Kash!)    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed map visual issue near The Gap&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed unpowered areas in North Tunnels, Crusher, Water Pumps, Snake Pass&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed location entities not covering parts of rooms&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed stuck spot in Pilot Drill&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Made the Cart Tunnel to Water Pumps vent exit more easily used&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Added partial cover to the ceiling of Operations so that the hive tendrils attach to something when a hive is dropped there.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Added lights to eliminate black spots in brew room and the water pumps vent.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Added collision geo to make walking in the lower section of Pilot Drill less frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Tweaked a few props in North Tunnels to make it less of a mess visually.&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Summit    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed some commander invisible issues with snow and waterfalls&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Veil    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removed collision of props above all doors&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed Onos stuck spot in Topographical&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Fixed various holes and minor gaps throughout the map&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Polished up some glass around the map to be shiny&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Added crate to allow Onos to get out of small pit in Topo near the gold pipes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that builder was attempting to use the wrong path for the nvcompress executable and couldn’t build any textures.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Editor    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added new Rotation Nudging tool to assist in getting precise placement and rotation of model props. New key-binds are available for this tool, but not set by default. These binds can be found under the “Edit” menu while using the Rotation Tools. To use this new feature, hover over the axis to rotate around and press the keys that were bound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that static prop collision visualization wasn’t properly scaled, and thus didn’t match the actual collision model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a micro stutter that can occur for players with less than 70 fps held consistently, while circle strafing, and using Windows 10. (strafing around an object while keeping your view centered on it.) We have a fix ready for the next patch. This stutter has been in the game for months, and was not introduced this patch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><author>WasabiOne</author><guid>2447032995762222818</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 13:32:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Podcast: Who s your favourite robot?</title><link>https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2394103650888962825</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Grow Home&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps ~~you   re~~ the robot? Did you ever think of that, huh? No, it   s fine, you   re a human, a human who likes the RPS podcast, the &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/the-rps-electronic-wireless-show/"&gt;Electronic Wireless Show&lt;/a&gt;. This week, we&amp;#8217;re chatting about our favourite mechanoids, cyberfolk and rust-buckets. Alec likes the robo-ostrich from &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, a bird capable of great speed (and good for showing off). Brendan is fond of the abandoned bots of &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/hackmud/"&gt;Hackmud&lt;/a&gt;, and their tragicomic existence on a humanless earth. Meanwhile, John loves little BUD of &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/grow-home/"&gt;Grow Home&lt;/a&gt; and his wobbly walking animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of large, bi-pedal machines, we&amp;#8217;ve also been playing strategy mech-em-up &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/battletech/"&gt;Battletech.&lt;/a&gt; Well, Alec has.

Hi all! Just a quick note. We found that in the prior update we released, a graphical bug was introduced where a texture showed up as missing. We&amp;#39;ve submitted a small patch to address this issue. Everything else should be the same, but as usual, if you have any issues with this patch, please report it in the Technical Support subforum!

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braid's protagonist Tim, seen here mid-jump. Art by &lt;a href="http://www.fitzhywel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Fitzhywel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braid is one of those games that rolls lazily off the tongue in conversations about the most influential indie games of all time. Depending which of the many breathless pieces you&amp;apos;ve read about it over the years, Braid was either an &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/braid-review?page=2" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;enormous leap towards realising the potential&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; of videogames that &amp;quot;ripped away&amp;#x2026;years of gaming blinkers&amp;quot;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/jan/26/casual-gaming-indiegames" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape of indie gaming&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly even gaming&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15videogames-t.html" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;Easy Rider&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; moment. It has a reputation as more than just a clever puzzler with a mind-bending rewind mechanic&amp;#x2014;it was a changing of the guard, a signal that independent games could finally compete with their big-budget counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even today, it&amp;apos;s still on people&amp;apos;s minds. Developers I&amp;apos;ve spoken to over the past few months have managed to slip it into conversations about seemingly unrelated topics, mentioning its brilliance or commercial success. But how influential was it actually? Did Braid directly inspire a generation of indie developers? Or was it just one indie project among many that managed to find an audience at a time when distribution platforms like Steam and Xbox Live Arcade were making games more accessible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In terms of graphics, aesthetics and emotion it was not particularly influential [on] me,&amp;quot; says Dino Patti, co-founder of Playdead, who now works at a new studio called Jumpship. Playdead developed Limbo, a game that&amp;apos;s often mentioned in the same sentence as Braid. Patti says that though he &amp;quot;really enjoyed the puzzles&amp;quot; and the way the time manipulation mechanic forced players to think &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot;, it didn&amp;apos;t stick in his mind any more than other games at the time.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was, however, keeping close tabs on its commercial success. Braid sold well when it came out in August 2008, shipping 55,000 copies in its first week on Xbox Live Arcade, and its numbers only ramped up when it came to Steam in April 2009. Jonathan Blow spent $200,000 making it, and by 2015 he&amp;apos;d raked in nearly $6 million. &amp;quot;I personally spent a lot of time analyzing [Braid&amp;apos;s] numbers,&amp;quot; says Patti, who was eager to convince investors that independent games could make money. Patti even spoke to Blow in 2009 about the ins and outs of releasing without a publisher. &amp;quot;We were looking very closely at how well it was doing,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were not influenced directly by its game design, but we were closely watching how games like Braid or World of Goo managed the business and marketing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jakub Dvorsk  , Amanita Design&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that success wasn&amp;apos;t unique. Patti says the team were watching &amp;quot;anything that did reasonably well back then&amp;quot;, including &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/Castle_Crashers/" target="_blank"&gt;Castle Crashers&lt;/a&gt;, which came out in the same month as Braid and sold better, racking up 103,000 players in its first three days. It would go on to be the best-selling Xbox Live Arcade game ever.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing Patti talk about Braid as just one game in a crowd surprises me, because out of all the indie games that found an audience in the years following Braid, Limbo is arguably the most directly comparable: it&amp;apos;s a puzzle-platformer that relies on atmosphere to tell a subtle story that&amp;apos;s open to interpretation. But I get the same message from Jakub Dvorsk&amp;#xFD;, chief executive and founder of Amanita Design, which released Machinarium a year after Braid first came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dvorsk&amp;#xFD; calls Braid a &amp;quot;very smart&amp;quot; puzzler and notes that it was &amp;quot;one of the first really successful indie games&amp;quot; but again, he sees it as part of a &amp;quot;wave of games&amp;quot;&amp;#x2014;which also includes the likes of World of Goo and Windosill&amp;#x2014;that started grabbing the attention of players and other developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We were not influenced directly by its game design, but we were closely watching how games like Braid or World of Goo managed the business and marketing,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Both World of Goo and Braid had an impact on us mostly in how they broke into the games market, how their developers handled communication with players and media, and what business decisions they made.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even when Braid&amp;apos;s success did influence Dvorsk&amp;#xFD;, it was largely confirming &amp;quot;what we already felt, that it&amp;apos;s possible to avoid publishers and use only storefronts who agreed on 70/30 or better revenue share&amp;quot;. Before those games came out, Amanita had &amp;quot;already decided&amp;quot; its direction of travel, having released point-and-click adventure Samorost 2 in 2005, which was successful enough for it to develop Machinarium independently.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s hard to disconnect the success of Braid and its contemporaries from the rise of platforms like Xbox Live Arcade and Steam, which made it easier than ever for indie developers to get their games in front of players. &amp;quot;The development became easier, and maybe even more importantly it also became possible to distribute and monetize games directly to players without having a publisher,&amp;quot; Patti says. &amp;quot;All of a sudden making smaller, low-budget games started to make sense.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people were able to succeed while making games they really believed in, that was inspiring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Greg Kasavin, Supergiant Games&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s a thought echoed by Greg Kasavin, writer and designer at Supergiant Games, developers of Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre. &amp;quot;Independent games were being created long before the success of something like Braid,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Kongregate launched in 2006, and [there was] stuff like Newgrounds, which Super Meat Boy came out of. There was always this scene of independent game creators making weird platformers and adventure games&amp;#x2026; but something like XBLA helped to make it a viable commercial business, and then it caught on with Steam.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Braid had more of an impact on Kasavin than it did on Dvorsk&amp;#xFD; or Patti. It was on a &amp;quot;shortlist of games&amp;quot; that made the Supergiant team realize that &amp;quot;small groups of people can make impactful games that could feel very meaningful and personal, as well as being high quality.&amp;quot; That list games included Plants vs. Zombies, World of Goo and, Castle Crashers, but Braid was &amp;quot;emblematic of both that era and the style of game.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the success of Braid and other games of the time, Kasavin says Supergiant wouldn&amp;apos;t exist. The fact that Braid and other games like it found a large audience gave the team confidence that there was a possibility for indie development to be financially viable. &amp;quot;Supergiant was self-funded, it was people drawing into their savings or asking their family for help, things like that, and we couldn&amp;apos;t have done that for fun. Even though we knew the chances were terrible, there had to be some sense that it was possible,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There was no part of us that thought we could be the next Braid or the next World of Goo, but the fact that these games did exist, that some people were able to succeed while making games they really believed in, that was inspiring both creatively and from the standpoint of trying to create a small studio.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask Kasavin how Braid inspired him personally, it&amp;apos;s clear that it&amp;apos;s a game close to his heart, and one that he feels shouldn&amp;apos;t simply be lumped in with others that came out at the same time. &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;apos;t call it a narrative game, but there&amp;apos;s absolutely the sense that it&amp;apos;s &lt;em&gt;about &lt;/em&gt;something. It&amp;apos;s not just a platformer for its own sake. Its mechanics and aesthetics are in service of a greater experience,&amp;quot; he says.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every ounce of that game felt like it was richly layered with subtext, that it was a deeply personal work, and a poetic work. I&amp;apos;d been playing games with impactful narratives since I was a kid, but the way in which Braid was able to take every aspect of its presentation and use it in service of a meaningful experience where every detail was intentional, that to me was inspiring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s easy to overstate the influence that Braid had on indie gaming. To some in the industry, it&amp;apos;s just one game (albeit it a memorable one) among many that happened to flourish in the indie boom of the late 2000s, which is itself tied closely to improvements in distribution through platforms like Steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;apos;t mean you should completely dismiss it. Without Braid, there would be no Bastion. There would be no Transistor, and no Pyre. And while Supergiant is just one studio, I have no doubt that others owe Braid a similar debt. 2008 and 2009 were years in which many talented developers were floating in the wind, having lost jobs at companies that were struggling with both the global financial crisis and the rising cost of making games. &amp;quot;You&amp;apos;re left with all these skilled developers wondering what they&amp;apos;re going to do, and they start seeing games like Braid, and they&amp;apos;re getting inspired,&amp;quot; Kasavin says.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braid&amp;apos;s release may not be the singular defining moment for the indie gaming explosion, but who knows how many games wouldn&amp;apos;t exist without it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/introducing-the-class-of-2008" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Class of 2008&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a series of retrospectives about indie games that were released 10 years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2758894130328215923</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 22:35:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Factorio 0.16.37 released</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2758894130327482704</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Factorio&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

for Audiosurf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninja Mono, Audiosurf's most popular mode, poses for a yearbook photo. Art by &lt;a href="http://www.fitzhywel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Fitzhywel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A telling difference between today&amp;apos;s indie games scene and that of 10 years ago is how excited Dylan Fitterer was to hear his game was going to be on Steam.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audiosurf had just been nominated for three IGF awards in the categories of Technical Excellence, Excellence in Audio, and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize. As Dylan tells it, &amp;quot;Then I got a call from Jason Holtman at Valve who said, &amp;apos;Hey, you want to sell this on Steam?&amp;apos; That blew me away. That was crazy to get an offer like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audiosurf went on to win the audio category as well as the audience vote, but the bigger prize was that it became February 2008&amp;apos;s top seller on Steam, both by number of copies sold and revenue, despite being an indie rhythm game that cost 10 bucks. It eventually sold over a million copies. Of course since this was 2008, it was one of only five games released on Steam that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best Game Ever Dot Com&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to that point was a road as bumpy as any of the rollercoaster levels Audiosurf makes out of the music you feed it. Like a lot of designers, Dylan&amp;apos;s first game ideas were way beyond his capabilities. &amp;quot;I was trying to build the biggest videogame possible, that incorporated everything,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;My first game I was working on was like Magic: The Gathering meets first-person shooter meets something else. Had everything in it, the one game that was all games. That was what I figured I&amp;apos;d just build, by myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years hitting his head against that wall he changed tack and went as far in the other direction as possible. From then on he only worked on games that could be finished in a week. &amp;quot;What I did is I launched this website called bestgameever.com and put up this promise that I&amp;apos;m gonna release a new game every Friday just to see if I could actually finish some things. And one of the things that I finished on there was called Tune Racer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original Tune Racer, which can still be found on &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040607201351/http://www.bestgameever.com:80/gamelog.php?id=P21" target="_blank"&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune Racer auto-detected whichever CD was in your drive at the time&amp;#x2014;this was 14 years ago, so of course you had CDs near at hand&amp;#x2014;and then matched the tempo of that music to a simple game about a car racing along a tube, overtaking other cars. Two sequels followed, tweaking the idea so that cars had to be dodged around instead of just overtaken (an idea that would return as Audiosurf 2&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/a-love-letter-to-audiosurf-2s-dusk-skin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dusk skin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was clearly something to the idea, something that kept drawing Dylan back. When he eventually decided it was time to invest more than a week in one of his concepts, to monetize one of those bestgameever.com prototypes, it was Tune Racer he turned to. He figured he could turn around a deluxe version in &amp;quot;like a month.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: it took longer than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;You should probably usability test your game&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan wasn&amp;apos;t alone. His wife Elizabeth, who had a day job at Microsoft, helped him over the course of what turned out to be several years of work. The two encountered plenty of dead ends along the way. They even tried to give Audiosurf a plot for a while, though he doesn&amp;apos;t recall the details. &amp;quot;My wife and I worked on a story, and I don&amp;apos;t remember if the motivation was like as an extended tutorial, or if it was just this lack of confidence that a game with no story would be compelling for people,&amp;quot; he recalls. &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;m not sure. It didn&amp;apos;t come together. It wasn&amp;apos;t a good idea.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is so hard. Watching people play your game that you think is almost there and you discover that you're not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dylan Fitterer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was a good idea was letting people use their own mp3s. Rhythm games with original scores have a hurdle to get over because players need to get used to the music before they can tap along with it, and even something like Rock Band can fall flat with players who don&amp;apos;t listen to the bands it favors. Audiosurf&amp;apos;s algorithm matches the curves of the track, the speed of your craft, and the placement of blocks to elements of the songs you choose, songs you already love. It transforms your mp3 collection into an explorable space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gP1vPijosDI"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My absolute favorite thing was to play this track from OCRemix in the game&amp;apos;s Mono mode. The simplicity of Mono mode and the intensity of the track made for a great flow experience.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x2014;Ben Prunty, composer of FTL and Into the Breach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The big beat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for most of Audiosurf&amp;apos;s development, the placement of blocks wasn&amp;apos;t in sync with the beat. &amp;quot;Those were basically random,&amp;quot; Dylan admits. &amp;quot;I had convinced myself that didn&amp;apos;t really matter. The track was shaped to the music and you just had these random patterns and you could maybe see the music in the patterns if you look hard enough or something. It made sense to me but Elizabeth, my wife, finally convinced me that was not a good idea.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra effort was worth it, although even then it wasn&amp;apos;t a game that clicked with everybody. Some people sat down to play and don&amp;apos;t feel the connection between the game and the song, no matter what music they choose. There just seems to be something in the way people are wired that determines whether it works for them or not. &amp;quot;We noticed that early on at trade shows. I think most people would see how it worked right away once they played, but some people get in and play and say, &amp;apos;I don&amp;apos;t see how it&amp;apos;s synchronized to the music.&amp;apos; We&amp;apos;d be in there clapping and stamping our feet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another worthwhile idea was thorough playtesting, and not just at conventions. The value of seeing how new players react to a game repeatedly over the course of its development is impossible to overstate. &amp;quot;My wife did a lot on it before anyone else,&amp;quot; Dylan says. &amp;quot;Toward the tail end she was working at Microsoft as a usability engineer in the Xbox group and so one night she comes home and says, &amp;apos;You should probably usability-test your game.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Oh, yeah. That&amp;apos;s a good idea.&amp;apos; We just hired friends and different people to play it and watch them play, and [we would] not talk. See where they get hung up. That is so hard. Watching people play your game that you think is almost there and you discover that you&amp;apos;re not even close.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BW3gKKiTvjs"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ll always connect Audiosurf to the voluptuous hillsides produced by Wuthering Heights, specifically the swell into the orgasmic walls of red. A decade on, I still shiver.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#x2014;Kieron Gillen, former PC Gamer editor and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/02/19/this-ones-going-to-run-and-run/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audiosurf leaderboard champ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Going ninja&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways Audiosurf began to differ from Tune Racer was that it wasn&amp;apos;t just about avoiding obstacles. It stopped being a game about weaving between blocks and became a game about collecting them, matching three of a kind into the grid at the bottom of the screen. &amp;quot;Through that usability testing that my wife and I did, we discovered that that was really hard to teach,&amp;quot; Dylan says. &amp;quot;It was hard enough explaining to people that you use your own music, that was foreign, then this other thing where you&amp;apos;re playing a match-3 game on this racetrack to music, it was too much to teach.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our timezones were so different that we'd have a call at midnight and tell them what we thought about the last batch of stuff and what we wanted the next day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dylan Fitterer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optional mono mode was the solution. It simplified things by reducing the blocks to two varieties, one to collect and one to dodge. &amp;quot;I thought that would just be a stepping stone or maybe just a tutorial mode and then that ended up being super popular.&amp;quot; Players wanted it to be more than just an introductory way of playing, so Dylan created &amp;apos;ninja mono&amp;apos; as the hardcore variant, and it became the way most players experienced Audiosurf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fitterers were helped across the finish line by several contractors, including artist Goran Delic who drew characters like the ninja for the select screen, and Paladin Studios, who built various 3D assets. &amp;quot;They did the vehicles and the geometry that&amp;apos;s alongside the track and the squid that&amp;apos;s at the end,&amp;quot; Dylan says. &amp;quot;That was a week or two weeks of work, right before launch. That was a lot of fun. Our timezones were so different that we&amp;apos;d have a call at midnight and tell them what we thought about the last batch of stuff and what we wanted the next day and we&amp;apos;d get up in the morning and check it out and put new stuff in the game.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, there was Valve. Their involvement went beyond just putting Audiosurf on Steam&amp;#x2014;it was the first third-party game given access to Steamworks, the full suite of tools Valve&amp;apos;s games use for everything from leaderboards to achievements. It also shipped with the soundtracks to The Orange Box games packaged in, and selecting certain songs from Portal triggered a &amp;quot;secret level&amp;quot; where you have a portal gun and some of the blocks are companion cubes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Audiosurf&amp;apos;s release those songs immediately became the most popular on its leaderboards, but competition broke out wherever players found songs that made particularly fun levels. So did arguments about which genres suited it best. &amp;quot;I don&amp;apos;t think there is an objective best or anything,&amp;quot; Dylan says, although he notes that his preference is for bands like Tool and Nine Inch Nails. &amp;quot;One of the things I like about industrial, Nine Inch Nails kind of stuff is it tends to have very big changes very rapidly, so a slow part, a very intense part, and that creates very cool moments.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those moments of drama and intensity when everything lights up and the track swoops around at speed are key to the appeal of Audiosurf, and when you find out a song you love hits one of those it&amp;apos;s even better. But as well as connecting you with music you&amp;apos;re already into, Audiosurf has helped players discover new music. Dylan himself learned a lot about what was popular in 2008. &amp;quot;I was a little behind the times I think. Like Dragonforce, that was huge. &amp;apos;What is this song everybody&amp;apos;s playing?&amp;apos; Podcasts were funny, there were people playing podcasts. I hadn&amp;apos;t thought to try that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fitterers followed Audiosurf with a sequel and a VR spin-off called Audioshield. But some day, Dylan says he&amp;apos;d like to go back to bestgameever.com and see what other forgotten treasures it holds. &amp;quot;I still have the domain, I just have this lame little placeholder on there right now. I have that site backed up I keep meaning to get it back online.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a strange week here at the Pleasuredome. Once again, a bud of the Hivemind prepares to detach and spread in-jokes and sinister, fungaloid thoughts about user interfaces to a new, unsuspecting host.  And I&amp;#8217;d only just confirmed he&amp;#8217;s real, too.  &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/28/adam-is-leaving-for-pastures-new-so-come-work-for-us/"&gt;Bye bye, Adam&lt;/a&gt;. Subvert from within, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, on the plus side, I high fived &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKwLKWaLjJ4"&gt;Aby Wolf&lt;/a&gt; the other night. And now it&amp;#8217;s time for &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/unknown-pleasures/"&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/a&gt;! Heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamelessly namedropping far more talented people we&amp;#8217;ve briefly orbited this week: chasing rabbits, redirecting lasers, and justifying patricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valve must pay a fine of AU$3 million (about   1.6m/US$2.3m/   1.8m) for misleading Steam users in Australia by stating they were not entitled to refunds for faulty games on Steam, though Australian law guarantees rights on faulty products. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) went after Valve for this back in 2014, before Steam offered widespread refunds, and in 2016 the Federal Court agreed. Valve appealed that court&amp;#8217;s decision but the High Court of Australia have now ruled that it stands, and that Valve must pay. They ACCC say that this &amp;#8220;is the final decision on this issue&amp;#8221;, the end of the line. &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/04/20/australia-fines-valve-over-steam-refunds/#more-536145" class="more-link"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AMD Ryzen crashes&lt;/h2&gt;The long fight with the elusive Ryzen bug (&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-231"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/8amxqg/amd_ryzen_entityrendererpreparerow_crash_87_times/"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;) seems to finally have some resolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I sent an email to AMD, filling them in on the details of the crash, and asked them if they could help us solve this. Very quickly I was put in touch with a member of their CPU engineering team, and they got to work with their investigation. After a few days, and after providing them all the information we have (log files, source code, crash dumps etc.), the cause of the issue was identified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some other developers in the industry also had this problem and worked with AMD to fix it, so it&amp;#39;s unlikely that the CPU bug was fixed only because of us, but we are honoured to have contributed to this. Unfortunately we do not have any technical or deep insight into where exactly the problem lay, or what the fix was, as it was somewhere between the motherboard BIOS and the Ryzen chipset drivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are running Factorio on a Ryzen system, we advise you to update your BIOS using the files and procedures found on your motherboard manufacturer&amp;#39;s website, and update your chipset drivers to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/chipset?os=Windows+10+-+64"&gt;latest version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PAX East Report&lt;/h2&gt;Two weeks ago we travelled to Boston to showcase our game at PAX East. I really like games and game conventions, so I was the lucky one who got to go to PAX East, after having already attended the Taipei Game Show. I was joined by Rseding91, v453000, Klonan, HanziQ and Jiri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Taipei, PAX was much larger, with a lot more players reacting positively to Factorio, and many more people knowing the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a 4 banners showing the base mentioned in &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-236"&gt;FFF-236&lt;/a&gt;, a TV playing the trailers, and PCs with the first two levels of the campaign (the first one was shortened quite a bit). These worked well together. The trailer got people hooked, the demo showed them what the game is about and the banners showed them that the game is very deep and complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We noticed a few categories of people coming to our booth (in order of most frequent):&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fans who already knew the game and wanted to show their appreciation, thank us or get some merchandise (we really should have brought more pins and t-shirts). Many of them would say &amp;quot;I wasted hundreds of hours in this game, you guys almost ruined my life&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Groups of friends passing by our booth, with one of them telling his friends &amp;quot;Oh, Factorio! Man, this game is amazing you guys really need to play it!&amp;quot;. They would then proceed to explain the game to their friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who heard about the game and wanted to give it a try.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People watching the trailers and having a chuckle when the biters get hit by the train.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every one else who sat down to play the demo, either stopping after the first short level or playing all the way to the end of the second, longer level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like last time, it seems that the event didn&amp;#39;t bring us much sales, but it&amp;#39;s hard to judge since we already had a spike in sales when we announced the price increase and 0.16 stable. Nonetheless it was definitely nice to be there and meet &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/8adsub/had_a_blast_meeting_the_dev_crew_these_guys_are/"&gt;the fans&lt;/a&gt;, other developers and members of the industry, and to play all kinds of games that were being demoed. It was also a great learning experience for us, in both event management and the impression that the game leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special thanks to RaZer and Dell Alienware for lending us the PCs for demoing the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there I filmed some short clips, including a few with our booth and edited them into a video. The quality is pretty bad since I accidentally set the camera to record in 640x480. You can see the video on my personal Youtube channel &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/BWrE8oGP1XQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;We also made a small album with some photos &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOo732WvGLz2XzNejIOAsC5lg3ZkFvgF_rbnXoRmADhgAbkbGN6JyDKgYNDRlGh6g?key=ZDBjRExJVzEtM3BVVnczZ3ZDWjZqRUEzeTRFU2Jn"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After PAX, HanziQ and Jiri visited New York City, while Rseding91 and I went to Los Angeles where we visited the Blizzard campus, Six Flags and also had &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/8bw0bb/the_factorio_la_meet_up_says_hi_thanks_to_rseding/"&gt;a small meetup with a few Factorio fans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/0d704dd5ef29debd83e74e5c4dd5445072349f64.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From left to right: v453000, Rseding91, Klonan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/fb986bc12b851daa7304ca423260ff5511355260.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/8cb6d8f57708e4b6ca65433ed073d2921799dbc3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, let us know the way you feel on our &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/59742"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2758894130316152516</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:36:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Psychonauts In The Rhombus Of Ruin jacks into PC</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2758894130316155770</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Psychonauts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s set right after Psychonauts, bridging the gap to the upcoming full sequel &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/psychonauts-2/"&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/a&gt;, and looks a little something like this: &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/04/20/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-released-on-pc/#more-536081" class="more-link"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin, the PlayStation VR-exclusive new chapter of Double Fine's adventure game series, is now available for other virtual reality devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched for PSVR in February 2017, Rhombus of Ruin is now available for PC to play on Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sort-of sequel to the original Psychonauts, Rhombus of Ruin can also be played as a standalone story. It's a decent return for the series, though, before the launch of the full Psychonauts 2 for PC and consoles - expected sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-20-pyschonauts-formerly-playstation-vr-exclusive-chapter-now-on-oculus-and-vive"&gt;Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2758894130315579705</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 10:48:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Awesomenauts 4.6: Tinker Time OUT NOW!</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2758894130312200041</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Awesomenauts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A big thanks to everyone who participated in the open beta for this update and shared their thoughts on some of the planned changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please share your thoughts on the update below or on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=6"&gt;our official forums&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re already working on a hotfix to address some unintended changes and bugs that crept into the release, so please stay tuned on that! This hotfix is slated to release on Friday 20th April, and we&amp;#39;ll have patch notes on that when we get closer to its release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full patch notes for Awesomenauts 4.6: Tinker Time are included below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Update 4.6: Tinker Time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/cf19c3b5917941055204147d2b4745161cdff74c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander Rocket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently too safe and very hard to catch, Rocket needs to be easier to punish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket Launch, no longer knocks back enemies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Base Health, reduced from 1150 to 1100&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laser Trap is too unreliable, doing either too much damage or none at all. These changes should make its effect more reliable while also making placement a little bit more skillful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, time between damage ticks increased from 0.2 to 0.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, damage per tick increased from 60 to 90.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, rotation speed increased by 50%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, laser length reduced by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, no longer has deployment time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, duration reduced from 4 to 3 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some upgrade adjustments based on the above changes. These are intended to keep Rocket brawling closer to his Laser Trap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profanity filters, now increases trap duration by 2 seconds for 160 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Borgo Cigar cutter, CMDR Rocket gets a shield which reduces 30% of the incoming damage as long as he is nearby a deployed laser trap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;This upgrade is still too strong and mandatory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Box of Cirean cigars, damage per particle per stage reduced from 20 to 16. 
&lt;em&gt;His Rocket Launch no longer deals damage to turrets, but his turret push is still too intense. Adjusting the numbers and making them more consistent.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charged Salvo, damage modifier against droids increased from 75% to 80%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charged Salvo, damage modifier against turrets reduced from 100% to 80%.
&lt;em&gt;This upgrade was a holdover from a time where Rocket’s Laser Trap had a lot more uptime. The intention for this replacement is to enable Rocket to be a bit better at brawling and allowing him to stay a bit closer to the fight&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Head in Jar, now adds 16% damage to Charged Salvo when firing a single rocket, two stages for 175 solar each. 
&lt;em&gt;Part of his safety comes from his relatively high ranged base attack.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charged Salvo, range reduced by 20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medal Booster Pack, range increase reduced from 25% to 20%.
&lt;em&gt;Combining Rocket Launch and a full Charged Salvo at melee range provides too much damage, too easily. At the same time we want to stimulate him to get more into the thick of the fight.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket Launch, now deals between 150 and 350 damage, depending on how long the rocket has been flying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mother of Bombs, after using Rocket Launch without hitting an enemy, your next Charged Salvo shot will deal 100 more damage for 170 solar. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/823d399cc943558129d3bb1f405c248306662d21.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Derpl&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We consider Derpl a bit too strongly affected by map choice and enemy team choices. Our intention is to weaken him a bit on the maps where he does too well, while also strengthening him against his counters.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siege mode, Derpl is no longer immune to CC during the transformation out of siege mode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siege mode, Derpl&amp;#39;s CC immunity now also works against timeslow effects and cocoons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combustion lava lamp, size increase reduced from 22% to 18%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Falling acceleration reduced by 20%.
&lt;em&gt;Traps can be very oppressive, maxing out at full 2.4 seconds of no gameplay for the receiving party. Their long lifetime also stimulates camping gameplay.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, snare duration reduced from 1.6 to 1.2 seconds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, now also slows for 30% for 2.4 seconds. (extenting 1.2 seconds beyond the snare)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, base lifetime reduced from 11 to 9 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Empowered Grid, snare increase per stage reduced from 0.4 to 0.3 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead casing, the silence now has a fixed duration of 2 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, now charges in the middle of Derpl instead of having an arming time when placed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, deployment time reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 seconds. 
&lt;em&gt;Some base attack adjustments to better balance the row and take the above changes into account.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat Cat, cooldown increased from 4 to 5 seconds, price increased from 185 to 195.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kitty Catsuit, price decreased from 175 to 150 solar per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAT package, price decreased from 175 to 150 solar per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bat Catsuit, now deals 100% increased damage against Nauts who are snared or slowed, no longer works with Fat Cat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long Cat, now works with Fat Cat.

&lt;strong&gt;Dizzy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dizzy is currently a bit too strong. But she&amp;#39;s also very finicky, and has a lot of weak upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi Dash, time between dashes increased from 0.3 to 0.4 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi Dash, damage per dash increased from 150 to 160.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walkbot Pro, speed up dash reload time by 30% when you are near to enemies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explosive Clone, cooldown increased from 6 to 7 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backstage pass, increase the range of your Multi Dash by 50% when you have the maximum amount of dashes charged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matching Glittery Dungarees, now reduces the cooldown for the next Explosive Clone by 3 seconds when it hits an enemy Awesomenaut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Purple Prince&amp;quot; lipstick, now also slows enemies when they leave the bubble as well as when they are hit by the explosion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bubble shot, size increased by 50%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graffiti artist, price increased from 165 to 190.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tipi teal, merged to one stage of 30% range and speed increase for 140 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/89e6d6a97346b9e10bb82ea3b76823a8a1089bdc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ix generally still brings too much to the table overall, great displace move, solid heals, invincibility frames, excellent mobility and strong brawling. In order to nudge him more towards his role his brawling should be reduced.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refract, cooldown increased from 9 to 10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiate, damage per Scatter reduced from 15 to 12.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mammoth hair scarf, ally speed bonus increased from 12% to 15% per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tree hugger, ally damage boost increased from 12% to 15% per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personality Crystal, range increase reduced from 35% to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/92056c0875f58423dbc8774bae1acad1ef54924d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lonestar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ribbit snail slime, fixed that the healthpack would time out if it fell for too long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since these aren’t that much better than regular boots, they also don’t have to cost much more.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket boots, solar price reduced from 160 to 140.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Base speed, increased by 4%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/32af7797f04668c4503d32c67c12e724841d75e0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This item has its use, but it&amp;#39;s too weak and expensive.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From pond to podium, merged into one stage which adds 30% range and speed for 200 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;The homing upgrade looks cool, but doesn&amp;#39;t do much. Here is a replacement proposal.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFO spotted, now gives +50% speed during Scene Illumination for 160 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;This upgrade is just a bit too expensive, especially given the next change.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sadak mysteries, price reduced from 195 to 175 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Removing the stacking will reduce the need to combo with Sadak.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brutalities of the Kraken, damage increased from 120 to 135 per stage, no longer stacks with Sadak mysteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;This item is just a bit too expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rob Bourgogne, price reduced from 180 to 160 per stage. 
&lt;em&gt;This item was overnerfed shortly after launch, because the skill was too strong to begin with at the time.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hairy King, size increase increased from 10% to 15%, price increased from 175 to 200 solar. 
&lt;em&gt;Some overpriced items.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don Steward, price per stage reduced from 175 to 140 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pete Jennirks, price reduced from 240 to 200 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incriminating dirt, price reduced from 180 to 150 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flying camera, price reduced from 210 to 150 solar. 
&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, this one&amp;#39;s underpriced.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hidden microphone, price increased from 170 to 200 solar. 
&lt;em&gt;This item is the strongest on the row, it doesn&amp;#39;t need to stack further.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Galactic police scanner, no longer stacks with incriminating dirt, price increased from 180 to 220 solar. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/ed41d63c6b924f52411cec848bbdf99405c2cae4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nibbs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firebreath, fixed that after being Cocooned by Genji during Firebreath she wouldn&amp;#39;t resume after the Cocoon wears off. 
&lt;em&gt;Some price adjustments.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skull dunduns, price reduced from 200 to 180.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eye of Coba, price reduced from from 215 to 190.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dragon Speaker Idol, now has two stages of +10% attack speed each, at 125 solar per stage. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/6531b00b86ae6b0bdbc084cc9daad93c01a40cfd.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Professor Yoolip&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Some adjustments to improve the item balance for the gaze row.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beard Trimming Fork, price reduced from 165 to 130 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syrup Pouring Robot, maximum lifesteal increased from 120 to 150 per stage. 
&lt;em&gt;Some changes to make Dinos more reliable at base.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summon Robo Dinos, now jump at enemies at base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summon Robo Dinos, damage per bite reduced from 80 to 75. 
&lt;em&gt;Now this upgrade has become useless.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holo Pet Food, now reduces the damage dealt by Nauts who have been bitten by 15% for 1.5 seconds. 

&lt;strong&gt;Qi&amp;#39;Tara&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made Qi&amp;#39;Taras seven star strike visual only in front of Qi&amp;#39;Tara to represent the area where damage was being applied better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that she couldn’t use Chakram Shift to teleport while using Seven Star Strike when the Salty Seal upgrade was bought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made Qi&amp;#39;Taras seven star strike visual only in front of Qi&amp;#39;Tara to represent the area where damage was being applied better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that the Lily of the Isle projectiles would spawn at her feet during Seven Star Strike. 
&lt;em&gt;Qi’Tara deals too much damage during Seven Star Strike, and too little outside of it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven star strike, attack speed increase reduced from 40% to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poisonous blade, direct damage increased from 45 to 50. 
&lt;em&gt;Her relationship with speed feels disjointed, where attacking slows her down but Seven Star Strike speed her up etc. These changes also tie in with the issue above.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poisonous Blade, removed movement penalty when attacking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven Star Strike, removed speed bonus during the ability. 
&lt;em&gt;With the changes above, this upgrade has now become useless. This change will make Qi’Tara’s damage output more reliable.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chilasi Chakram, now speeds up the damage over time of Poisonous blade by 20% for 160 solar. 
&lt;em&gt;Since the bug was fixed where this upgrade doubled your damage, this upgrade has become too weak&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lily of the Isle, projectile speed and range increased by 30%.
&lt;em&gt;Salty Seal makes Qi’Tara almost unstoppable, this change should make counterplay possible again&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salty Seal, now activates a shield that blocks 100 damage and provides immunity against slows, stuns, snares, chains, gravity and time warps as long as it’s active. 
&lt;em&gt;Other tweaks and adjustments.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven star strike, now also gives a 10% lifesteal effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baby plumbin oil, additional lifesteal reduced from 30% to 15% for 175 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rakki Comb, merged to one stage which adds 200% damage vs. droids for 155 solar. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/c3e6b9ea5315191e6b97f4d8f5951b5c8162cf62.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Raelynn&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iron Rifle, fixed that the shield didn’t last long enough to protect the entire charge duration. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/7a582ca443e88ea8625584a74d664a6f6567dd19.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rocco&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Birdseed donuts, cooldown reduction when hit increased from 2 to 4 seconds, duration increase increased from 1 to 2 seconds. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/01394ae6ab660d8f2b8eecb87756a5579245d737.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scoop&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;His base attack is a bit too weak in general&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sword Strike, Slash damage increased from 100 to 105, Cleave lifesteal increased from 20% to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Banner of the Triple Scoop, price per stage reduced from 130 to 100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Halberd of Justice, bonus damage reduced from 25% to 22%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Titanium Coneshield, price increased from 130 to 150 solar per stage.
&lt;em&gt;Other tweaks and adjustments&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brutally Whipped Cream, price reduced from 200 to 180 per stage. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/713fb830953afd54abcf5557ac9a64e88e95c9a4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sentry&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that Sentry’s Beacon no longer emitted a phone interference sound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that Starstorm statue didn&amp;#39;t affect Bug detector. 
&lt;em&gt;Reducing his efficiency of laying down mines in choke-points which has little to no counter-play.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mines, damage while stationary reduced from 80 to 70. 
&lt;em&gt;With this change in mind, a counter-buff to help him land reliable damage output in close ranged scenarios.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mines, damage on direct hit increased from 80 to 90.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Projectile speed of mines increased by 15%.
&lt;em&gt;Camouflage tent is currently emphasizing passive play. This change will reward aggressive use of his AA by increasing his chase potency and reliability.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camouflage tent, now increases projectile speed and range by 18%, one stage for 175 solar. 
&lt;em&gt;Drive-over skulls is also providing a lot of easy chip damage and can be replaced with a more active timing based auto-attack.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive-over skulls, now deals +75% direct damage when not firing for 1.5s. 
&lt;em&gt;Currently Black Hole Sun feels inconsistent and very hard to avoid, and if avoided it lingers for a whole 1.5s. This is an attempt at making BHS a more reliable ability and feel more fair on both ends. Starting with rewarding precision and aim on Sentry&amp;#39;s end while allowing enemies to dodge the skill easier.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, projectile distance increased by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, projectile speed increased by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, size of black hole reduced by 18%.
&lt;em&gt;The next set of changes are both aimed at compensating for the size reduction but also to reduce the duration of BHS.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, minimum gravity increased by 8%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, maximum gravity increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, duration of black hole reduced from 1.5s to 1.2s. 
&lt;em&gt;With these changes aside, his shield charging up also adds up a lot of time where he&amp;#39;s difficult to punish. Reducing his shield duration both allows him for using his black hole quicker, while also being vulnerable faster.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shield duration reduced from 2s to 1.5s. 
&lt;em&gt;With less up-time of his shields, his base shield scaling could be increased to fulfill his tanky role. This allows him to tank a little extra in fights and reward aggressive play.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, Base shield increased from 20% to 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microfilm, shielding reduced from 10% to 8%, price reduced to 140 solar per stage. 
&lt;em&gt;Some Sentry&amp;#39;s just leave their beacon sitting somewhere in order to reveal or permanently put pressure on an area.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teleport Beacon, times out after 45 seconds. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/533ccae8a301b7a6bcef4fbf5a4f4d898dd7768d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Skree&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made separate spawnpoints for Sawblade and Spare blade, and moved them apart a little.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sawblade, now deals direct damage instead of damage over time. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/033fc68a9b5c59a6506c8ae4255a147a60ccc750.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Smiles&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Smiles has been overnerfed in the last few updates.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Base health, increased from 1550 to 1650.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trapper’s hook, cooldown reduced from 10 to 8 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bush fire, range increased by 25%.
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/36aa2148c877b5ffaaec29de1e2eb29778af0b34.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swiggins&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poolboy, price reduced from 240 to 210 solar. 
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/04d99daf1b3c440ab3cc1dcc537d922ea50d6a19.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yuri&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrono Rift, cooldown reduction per stage reduced from 2.5 to 2 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uranium spikes, price increased from 125 to 150 per stage.&lt;/li&gt;</description><author>Mitaki</author><guid>2758894130312200041</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 12:21:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Persistence  Permadeath: progression in Spelunky, Into the Breach and roguelikes</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2758894130309538354</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Spelunky&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progression is so often an illusion. Many games use the idea of permanent progression as a way of tickling our lizard brains with a growing pile of loot or numbers which constantly tick up, so that we feel like we   re achieving something while we sit in front of a computer and repeat the same set of tasks over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of permadeath is that it does away with all this. Characters grow and collect things, but then they become permadead, and it   s time for a new explorer to begin their adventure. The only thing that progresses is you, the player, slowly learning a set of systems with each failure. At least, that   s the theory. We spoke to the designers of &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/spelunky/"&gt;Spelunky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/into-the-breach/"&gt;Into the Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/dead-cells/"&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/rogue-legacy/"&gt;Rogue Legacy&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about persistence within a permadeath mould.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2018/articles/2018-04-13-14-08/the-horror-of-vault-11-1523624883622.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1966774.jpg" alt=""/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestled in the mountains, the door that leads to Vault 11 is the kind you see hammered onto a shack. It is rotting wood and nails and spider webs clinging on to existence like the people of Fallout's post-apocalyptic Mojave Wasteland. The Brotherhood of Steel have sent us here to find a differential pressure controller, one of the parts needed to repair their faulty air filtration system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brotherhood said nothing about the horrors inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vault 11 is unusual in that when you first arrive its main door, the one with the number 11 on it, the one would normally hiss and creak before pulling back and rolling sideways, is open. Most of the vaults you encounter throughout the Fallout games are locked shut, which makes sense. The vaults were designed to keep nuclear fallout out and happy dwellers in. Why is Vault 11's door open now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-17-the-horror-of-vault-11"&gt;Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2758894130307783779</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Unknown Pleasures: The five best new games on Steam</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2758894130302757654</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Steam&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

End of term holidays are when you&amp;#8217;re supposed to be indoors playing games, not studying or going outside like some sort of peon. Bah.

&lt;p&gt;Why, I bet they don&amp;#8217;t even know what &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/unknown-pleasures/"&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/a&gt; is named after.&lt;/p&gt;

It was intended to task players with purifying the world of the Corruption by finding and activating purifying towers that push back the spread. The idea was that it would include more strategy and RPG elements, such as a new tower defense mechanic, as well as a skill tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-05-terraria-company-ditches-spin-off-maker-after-troubled-development"&gt;Terraria owner Re-Logic rebooted Otherworld&lt;/a&gt; after dumping Dutch developer Engine Software in favour of Pipeworks, a studio that did Terraria re-write work on console and mobile. This after what sounded like a troubled development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-16-terraria-spin-off-otherworld-cancelled-three-years-after-it-was-announced"&gt;Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2758894130300925891</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 09:39:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ken Levineless Bioshock in development at secret 2K studio</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2758894130295224782</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for BioShock&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Irrational Games was dismantled in 2014, the future of the &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/bioshock"&gt;Bioshock&lt;/a&gt; IP was left twisting in the wind. It certainly wasn&amp;#8217;t going to fall on former studio head Ken Levine, as he departed to run a smaller studio called &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/24/ghost-story-games/"&gt;Ghost Story Games&lt;/a&gt; which would have nothing near the production scale required to take on a new time-period magic-potion exercise in the violence of political ideologies and/or golf. But as part of a much larger 2K expose written this week over at &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177"&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt;, it appears news has leaked regarding a Bioshock title in development at a super secret 2K studio. Or at least, you know, previously super secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraria: Otherworld has had a rough old time since developer Re-Logic &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/terraria-otherworld-is-a-new-terraria-game-but-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank"&gt;announced it in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. A year later it &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/terraria-otherworld-is-still-happening-but-its-been-revamped/" target="_blank"&gt;was revamped&lt;/a&gt;, and last year co-developer Engine Software was &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/terraria-otherworld-update-reveals-a-new-development-partner/" target="_blank"&gt;dropped from the project&lt;/a&gt;. So it&amp;apos;s not entirely surprising that the game&amp;#x2014;which was a more focused, strategic spin-off of Terraria&amp;#x2014;has now been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/this-is-the-end-otherworld-development-cancelled.68594/" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Re-Logic explained that Otherworld was a long way behind schedule, and still far short of the game the team wanted it to be. &amp;quot;Taking the massive amount of work that would be remaining to complete along with the extensive time it would take to get that done, and how that would greatly interfere with the pursuit of other projects on behalf of Re-Logic, it becomes clear that this leaves things in a very undesirable state,&amp;quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At some point, we have to be honest with ourselves and realize that Otherworld simply is never going to reach its potential in any sort of reasonable time or fashion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It admitted that it shouldn&amp;apos;t have announced the project at such an early stage, and that it will only talk about games &amp;quot;in which we are fully confident in regards to timing&amp;quot; in the future. It also said it was a mistake to partly outsource development to another team, and that future projects are likely to be kept in-house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Otherworld will never see the light of day, some of its best ideas will make it into the studio&amp;apos;s future games, Re-Logic said. Finally, it said that the cancellation will not impact the active development of Terraria, which continues as planned.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2758894130294437594</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2018 14:22:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Friday Facts #238 - The GUI update (Part II)</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2758894130292085714</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Factorio&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GUI update (Part II) - Technology tree&lt;/h2&gt;Today we will speak a bit about the work in progress of the Technology tree, and the main GUI style/philosophy evolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The visual style is evolving and becoming more mature. The aim is to be as functional as possible, and also be pleasant to interact with, always having in mind the limitations of making it work in our engine. This is why we bet for a neutral and sober look that helps to focus on the relevant elements, without the distraction of possible decorative elements. This is not easy to decide, because the tradition of video-games is very rich in decorative GUI elements, and I&amp;#39;m sure that many of you would prefer having screws and rust in the corners of the metal panels and cables hanging everywhere in the GUI. Me too. Sometimes. I believe that once the GUI is completely functional, there will be some minimal decoration and this kind of fantasy, but this will be another chapter if it ever happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are paying a lot of attention to the readability in general, according to the AAA standards of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines"&gt;WCAG&lt;/a&gt;. So the contrast with the panels and the font is increased quite a lot compared to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-212"&gt;previous mock-ups&lt;/a&gt; by simply using a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://contrastchecker.com/"&gt;contrast checker&lt;/a&gt;. Also the font size is increased by 2pt so it is more comfortable to read. Anyway, the user will have control of the font size in the options menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that the next mock-ups are a work in progress, and we still developing our standards, so some colours and solutions can vary through further iterations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting to the point - Research queue&lt;/h2&gt;This picture shows the actuality of the state of the technology tree:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/e705d0b5738c0d9d5d314f70b98d50d9307ecab2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the top left frame we added a new functionality. In this panel you can organize the order of your researches and see the progress in real time.&lt;br /&gt;The player will be able to cancel a queued technology just by hovering the card and pressing the cancel button. This progress is attached to the card, and will also be visible in the tree itself.&lt;br /&gt; See the screen below. The fluid wagon has been researched and you can see this in the tree and in the queue.&lt;br /&gt;By using the principle that, when the GUI tells you about some element, it always tries to use this very element, not a representation of it in another frame of the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/24f4855125ca23145ff7708486600424afb5ebc7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Featured Technology&lt;/h2&gt;The index of technologies remains as it is, but the position of the Featured technology frame is now attached to the tech tree, next to the technology itself. The link between the type of technology and info or interactions related to it, are physically tied. We are trying as much as possible to interact with the elements in situ, trying not to open unnecessary frames or pop ups of any kind and lose our visual focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/3d80016ae0e87807b57bb66ee2fb9e0764524acd.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/b48d966896ed4fa4cfe81574f22b67bb00a3ba47.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/3d80016ae0e87807b57bb66ee2fb9e0764524acd.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/a0898b23a4d337db0fab31d8d22a06cdf5fff20e.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same happens with the research/queue button. It is placed on top of the featured technology and wraps it with a color indicating it&amp;#39;s state, and providing the possible interaction. When the technology is researched, or unavailable, the button appears pressed and the color changes.&lt;br /&gt;The color code of the cards remains as before, we have just added a new orange state. Yellow for available, orange for queued, red unavailable, and green researched.As said above, tonalities may change in future, but this is pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/f1e55a9a1ed6609d377ab018a50a4f6da7e8a08c.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The opposition&lt;/h2&gt;As this is a dev blog post, it might be nice to show you some internal part of the process. The thing is, that my domain is mainly programming and gameplay, and Alberts domain is graphics. GUI is often something in between, so the two views on the subject tend to be hard to agree on occasionally. In situations like this, and I can tell you that there were a lot of these over the years, we are able to argue for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proposal comes to me and the inevitable discussion about how is the GUI actually going to be implemented. I really love the overall change of the looks, it suddenly looks so much better and professional. But obviously, different people have different priorities, and are used to different things in UI.&lt;br /&gt;I personally had problem understanding, that the &lt;em&gt;Queue&lt;/em&gt; button is actually a button on a first glance. I&amp;#39;m used to the standard (not only in Factorio), that a confirmation button is in the right bottom corner of every window. I am also used to the fact that text button just looks the same everywhere, so I can recognize that it is a button instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reference I would like to show the blueprint confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/91c214c87da9dc7ed634b28bf2fa27ee609f81eb.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was never designed by Albert, and will be touched by the UI changes in 0.17, but it might be a good lesson about standards for us anyway. It is the confirm like window, that doesn&amp;#39;t have the confirmation button as a text button in the right bottom corner. It has a sprite button in the top right corner instead. We have it in the game for quite some time, so we should be used to it, but I still feel like I&amp;#39;m lost for split of second when this window appears and I would actually prefer if it was standardized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that there is very good reason to have the proposal done this way, both graphically and logically, and I&amp;#39;m aware that Alberts understands the importance of standardisation more than me. We might just have different views on what is the more important principle when these come into conflict. It might be interesting to see what has the reader to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;As you can see, the GUI re-design tries to be very respectful to the current one, making changes only when is very clear to us that is for the best of Factorio, and not for the sake of changes. I&amp;#39;d like to talk about more subjects, like multi-resolution, HR tile-set, modularity, animations, other mechanics and some more GUI philosophy, but it&amp;#39;s late and there are more Fridays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m very curious to see what you think about it in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/59598"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;.</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2758894130292085714</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2018 22:46:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sandbox spinoff Terraria: Otherworld has been cancelled</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2758894130291960662</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Terraria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Terraria developers Re-Logic have announced that they&amp;#8217;re pulling the plug on &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/terraria-otherworld/"&gt;Terraria: Otherworld&lt;/a&gt;. First unveiled three years ago, it promised a more adventure-focused spin on the  platforming/building  sandbox mega-hit &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/terraria/"&gt;Terraria&lt;/a&gt;, with more of a focus on fighting, defending your bases, and navigating complex environments. The project has looked a bit wonky for some time now, and last year &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/04/05/terraria-otherworld-switches-to-new-developer/"&gt;development duties changed hands&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s still sad to see it canned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Room cofounder and composer Jessica Curry summarises her initial pitch for a live performance of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dear-esther-review/" target="_blank"&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/a&gt; in a typically humorous manner: &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ve had this possibly really bad and commercially unviable idea&amp;#x2014;how would you feel about it?!&amp;quot; She was speaking with the Barbican&amp;apos;s Contemporary Music Programmer, Chris Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea came during a Film, Archive and Music Lab (FAMLAB) week Curry was attending. &amp;quot;They were talking about composers and how they work with silent film in terms of putting that into a concert experience,&amp;quot; she says. She began to ponder that in relation to her expertise in videogame music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp has previously summed up the Barbican&amp;#x2019;s work as &amp;#x2018;Slightly Insane Ideas Made Reality&amp;#x2019;, so Curry&amp;#x2019;s proposal would seem a perfect fit for that remit. &amp;quot;They were amazing from start to finish,&amp;quot; she says of the Barbican. &amp;quot;They were really creatively on board with it but also incredibly practical, because what we quickly discovered is that it was technically really challenging.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges was that the live performance would require Dear Esther to be rebuilt. The most obvious reasons are that, for a live show with live narration and music, the existing music and narration needed to be stripped from the game. &amp;quot;I thought it can&amp;#x2019;t be that hard but you know what it&amp;#x2019;s like with game development&amp;#x2014;you change one thing and everything starts crashing around you!&amp;quot; says Curry. The game was five years old by then and The Chinese Room had to relearn the processes and idiosyncracies of the original in order to tweak it. &amp;quot;The QA involved in that was massive because so many dependencies had changed,&amp;quot; explains Curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rewired&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conductor and actor also needed the game to provide cues for the different pieces of music or segments of script required. That meant re-evaluating how the tripwires in the game&amp;#x2014;the triggers for things like segments of dialogue&amp;#x2014;worked. In the original game the idea is that you get a different experience each time you play because there are a huge number of possible permutations.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x2019;s fine when you have code handling those responses. When it&amp;#x2019;s a human on stage the limitations are different. Fellow Chinese Room cofounder Dan Pinchbeck thus needed to create a version of the script which catered to the limits of a human performer and to the fact that attendees would likely only attend one performance.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask about the logistics of the tripwires given you&amp;#x2019;d need to factor in a few extra seconds for a human to respond to a prompt from the game. &amp;quot;Now you&amp;#x2019;re beginning to understand the fresh hell I led everybody into!&amp;quot; laughs Curry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#x2019;t just figuring out cues and removing elements of audio. Invisible walls had to be added a week before the initial show to prevent the player falling off cliffs during a performance. There was also a long discussion about whether to keep or remove the game&amp;#x2019;s loading screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curry tells me it was a conscious choice to leave the loading screens in. The idea was &amp;quot;to not apologise for it being a game&amp;quot; and instead to celebrate it. That&amp;#x2019;s how it worked for me, but others found it jarring. It&amp;#x2019;s a peculiarly technological moment in a very human performance.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, decisions about what to change and how were governed by whether they helped create a live version of the existing game experience rather than a separate, perhaps more theatrical, entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, in game form Curry had been able to exert absolute control over how Dear Esther sounded at any given point. As a live performance, she had to figure out how to separate out the elements so they still worked cohesively but could be differentiated by the listeners. Each venue also introduced differences to the sound and the team had mere hours to figure out how to adapt each night.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an experienced crew helped, as did a sound engineer with both live expertise and a more detached perspective: &amp;quot;Sometimes, because I knew the soundtrack so well in my head it was almost like I couldn&amp;#x2019;t hear a new version of it,&amp;quot; Curry says. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Centre stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human player is another performance element which has changed over the tour. By the final UK date the PC monitors had gone from being side-on to facing the audience and the player was now lit in the same manner as the musicians. Curry and the team are still tinkering with that presentation for the international dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live performance also introduces the possibility that part of the show will break. As a result there are two projectors and two computers in place, plus a screenshot to cut to in the event of some tech failure and emergency music specifically written by Curry to cover downtime.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stresses aside, the resulting Dear Esther tour has been a rewarding and rejuvenating experience for Curry. The close-knit team offered a protective, nurturing environment, and the instant positive feedback of a live audience enthralled by her work has been a delight.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the success here is transferrable to other live games events is a difficult question. Dear Esther is about 75 minutes long, was made on a tight budget with one narrator and few musicians, and is the product of a studio that&amp;#x2019;s interested in removing traditional &amp;#x2018;play&amp;#x2019; elements from games. It&amp;#x2019;s suited to a live show in ways that hundred-hour epics with action sequences and full orchestral scores aren&amp;#x2019;t. Regardless, Dear Esther&amp;#x2019;s live tour was a technologically fascinating and emotionally rewarding experience.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394102381818446769</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:33:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Podcast: Bad games with a great story</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2394102381818426507</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spies come in many forms, so the best spy games on PC could be tense games about intrigue and infiltration, or high octane adventures starring a special agent. It would be good to see more games focusing on spycraft, espionage, and subterfuge, but we can make do with putting on some cool glowing goggles to infiltrate a base. Here are some of our favourite games starring awesome spies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alpha Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gloriously janky RPG from Obsidian that casts you as crack spy Michael Thorton. This was a brave attempt to combine Mass Effect style conversation and branching plot systems with a cover-based shooter. The combat side of things is a mess, so it&amp;#x2019;s worth looking up the different weapon classes so you know which disciplines to avoid (I found pistols worked well enough). It&amp;#x2019;s worth playing through the dodgy action to roleplay your favourite flavour of spy&amp;#x2014;pick your JB: Jason Bourne, James Bond, or Jack Bauer.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Alpha Protocol is the branching plot. The alliances you choose will change the order you visit each continental hub, and can have a huge impact on the characters you meet and the endings you unlock.&amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This classic stealth sandbox came out 13 years ago, but still perfectly captures the thrill of being an action movie covert agent. It&amp;#x2019;s like Hitman, but you have cooler gadgets and the ability to suspend yourself above guards by doing the splits.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Sam Fisher&amp;#x2019;s finest hour thanks to Michael Ironside&amp;#x2019;s performance and a darkly humourous script. Chaos Theory features some exceptional level design, and a decent co-op campaign that encourages you to co-ordinate sweet simultaneous takedowns from the shadows. &amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No One Lives Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few spy games to draw influence from the cheesy Man From Uncle meets Austin Powers 1960s idea of a spy adventure. As the glamorous Cate Archer you fight through jump out of planes, race bikes, scuba to sunken ships and other antics you might expect from Roger Moore era Bond. Every mission is different, and the whole adventure is played for laughs. It&amp;#x2019;s a difficult game to get hold of, and tough to get fully working on current machines, but it goes down as a great spy game in the PC gaming canon.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SpyParty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paranoia is an important part of being a spy. Your cover could be blown at any moment, and the consequences are drastic. In fact someone could be watching you through a high-powered scope &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. SpyParty captures this feeling in a series of small scenes&amp;#x2014;a party in a pub, a penthouse party, a boat party (spies love to party). One player plays a sniper, assessing the scene for any signs of spy-like behaviour. The other player is the spy. As the spy you have to blend in with NPCs as naturally as you can while you saunter around completing secret objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the spy you can see the sniper&amp;#x2019;s targeting laser moving through the room. It&amp;#x2019;s terrifying to see it flick from one side of the room to your forehead after you make a sloppy move. On the plus side you can see when the sniper is obsessed with innocent NPCs and use them as cover to plant that bug you need to win.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Invisible, Inc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infiltrate high-security environments as a group of specialists in this hybrid of stealth game, turn-based strategy and roguelike. Get in, run the job, then get out again, and use your agents&amp;apos; different abilities to make it happen. This is a meticulous spy game where every wrong move can cost you dearly (you can rewind a turn if you&amp;apos;ve messed up that badly), but every well-executed strategy will make you feel like a badass.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Invisible Inc is that you can customise the parameters of a campaign to your preferences&amp;#x2014;adjust the amount of credits you get, how long each campaign goes on for and how many guards you can expect to find in each mission. Even though it gets real tricky, the difficulty is very much in your control. On additional playthroughs, you&amp;apos;ll unlock new agents who provide you with a different power base.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Samuel Roberts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Covert Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sid Meier&amp;#x2019;s spy game was remarkably ambitious for 1990. You investigate randomly generated missions by infiltrating facilities, planting bugs, stealing files, tailing suspects and decrpting codes. Each of these activities has its own minigame. To decrypt a code you have to decode a scrambled message under time pressure. To infiltrate a building you pick a loadout, slip into the premises and start photographing documents with a microcamera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks ropey by today&amp;#x2019;s standards, but Covert Action has remarkable breadth of scope that few games attempt today. There&amp;#x2019;s a reason for that, perhaps. Sid Meier was unhappy with the disparate nature of the Covert Action&amp;#x2019;s minigames, and felt as though the activities detracted from the overall mission, which involved tracking down spies in a network to find the mastermind.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;KGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in Russia during the last days of the Soviet Union, this brutally difficult point-and-click adventure sees you investigating corruption within the KGB&amp;#x2014;at least to begin with. Over the course of the game, protagonist Maksim, a KGB captain, finds himself swept up in a conspiracy involving the murder of a former agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x2019;s from 1992 so it&amp;#x2019;s hardly the most slick or accessible of adventures, but its depiction of Cold War espionage is brilliantly done and uncompromisingly realistic in places. There are numerous ways to suddenly die, including being executed for speaking out of turn to your superiors. KGB was also released on CD-ROM under the name Conspiracy, featuring FMV cutscenes that starred Donald Sutherland as Maksim&amp;#x2019;s late father.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Andy Kelly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gunpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steal secrets in (former PC Gamer staffer) Tom Francis&amp;apos;s stealthy puzzle/platformer, where you play a spy who can hack and control different parts of a building&amp;apos;s security system. What I remember liking about Gunpoint more than anything is its length&amp;#x2014;you&amp;apos;ll clear it in about three or four hours, but in that time you&amp;apos;ll go from being shot dead a bunch of times by guards to perfecting its systems and skilfully bounding in and out of buildings. It&amp;apos;s perfectly paced, with no unnecessary levels or dull bits.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like immersive sims, this reframes most of their core elements into a 2D game. Plus you can smash your little spy guy through windows, which feels really good.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Samuel Roberts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Tactical Espionage Action&amp;#x201D; is Metal Gear Solid&amp;#x2019;s tagline. In some ways the first game captures the spy fantasy better than the rest of the series, because in MGS Snake is an underdog rather than a legendary battlefield soldier. Snake&amp;#x2019;s hushed conversations with his handlers over intercom create a sense that you&amp;#x2019;re camped behind enemy lines, and it&amp;#x2019;s a dedicated stealth game. The worst thing you can do is get spotted by a guard. That brash alert noise is burned into my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x2019;s a good introduction to Kojima&amp;#x2019;s brainverse. Expect bizarre bosses and a tendency to reach through the fourth wall. The spy fantasy starts to falter when you get into the extraordinary melodrama of the finale, but overall it&amp;#x2019;s a clever spy game that stands up today. Now we just need the brilliant Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater to make the leap to PC.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Neon Struct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cyberpunk spy thriller that pays homage to Deus Ex, Neon struct is a slick heist game that challenges you to complete missions non-lethally. You have a bunch of sci-fi gadgets that can scramble gadgets and turn lights off at range, but its best move is a totally silent slide move that can get you out of trouble.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You explore city hubs between missions. That&amp;#x2019;s where you buy gadgets and stims that make you invisible in short bursts. It&amp;#x2019;s a neat little spy game with a stylish low-fi look, though Andy found the sparse sound design offputting in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/neon-struct-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;our review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x2014;Tom Senior&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394102381817941786</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 15:07:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The creators of Spelunky and Getting Over It talk about Sexy Hiking and 'B-games'</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2394102381815455359</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for Spelunky&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexy Hiking, by Jazzuo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexy Hiking was the original game about having to climb obstacles with a hammer controlled by a mouse. It was infuriatingly difficult. Back in August of 2007 Derek Yu, now known as the creator of Spelunky, wrote it up for his website &lt;a href="https://www.tigsource.com/2007/08/13/sexy-hiking/" target="_blank"&gt;TIGSource&lt;/a&gt;, saying &amp;quot;every new area seems totally impossible at first, and there is NOTHING THERE TO HELP YOU SAVE YOUR OWN GRIT.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strange game about a cartoon man with floating hands was made by an enigma from Poland known as &amp;quot;Jazzuo&amp;quot;. Jazzuo released a string of B-grade games online, small and ugly and odd things with control schemes that seemed designed by aliens. While rarely remembered today, they were an important influence on the indie games that would follow&amp;#x2014;most obviously Sexy Hiking&amp;apos;s spiritual sequel Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Yu and Foddy to talk us through the strange world of Jazzuo, and B-games in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, by Bennett Foddy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PC Gamer: How did you get into Jazzuo&amp;apos;s games? What was the first one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bennett Foddy:&lt;/strong&gt; I read about Sexy Hiking on Derek Yu&amp;#x2019;s TIGSource website back in, oh, 2007 or so. Even then it had been out for a number of years, but Derek revived it with this post. As he anticipated, it was an extremely controversial title in the TIGSource community. Adam Saltsman (of Canabalt and Overland fame) called it &amp;quot;the single worst game I have ever played&amp;quot;. Honestly, at the time I dismissed the game, but it became something of a meme among indie game developers, and I never really forgot about it. Years later, I changed my opinion of the game when I showed it to my students at NYU, as part of a class on games by European developers, and I realized how timeless the design was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Getting Over It is great because it brought outsider art to the masses in a respectful way. But it's still worth experiencing the original&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Derek Yu&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek Yu:&lt;/strong&gt; The things I loved about Sexy Hiking are what I assume people love about Getting Over It now&amp;#x2014;a unique and frustrating challenge coupled with a bizarre premise. Sexy Hiking does beat Getting Over It in one particular category, however, and that&amp;apos;s the title. While &amp;quot;Getting Over It&amp;quot; is a good name and Bennett was, for a long time, considered an expert namer of games on the TIGSource Forums, I think even he would agree that &amp;quot;Sexy Hiking&amp;quot; is one of the best game names of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BF:&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely one of the best titles! Other than Sexy Hiking, the best ones are Sexy Hand and GM Golf. Be careful, some of his games are in extremely poor taste!&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM golf challenge, by Jazzuo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the most essential ones to play&amp;#x2014;what&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;the Jazzuo canon&amp;apos;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DY:&lt;/strong&gt; He created another game in 2007 called &lt;a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=485.0" target="_blank"&gt;Hermies the game&lt;/a&gt; that was very similar in concept to 2016&amp;apos;s Genital Jousting. I have no idea if the creators of Genital Jousting played Hermies, but either way it&amp;apos;s proof that Jazzuo was ahead of his time. He made the game for the TIGSource B-Games Competition (which was partly inspired by him) and it won 4.5% of the votes but did not win the competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Jazzuo&amp;apos;s games so special to me is how raw they are. When I play a game by him or a similar creator, it always feels intimate and honest. As a game developer, it&amp;apos;s tempting to start obsessing over polish and making sure the player has a nice, comfortable time, and his games are a reminder that we&amp;apos;re also artists trying to express something of ourselves. I think Getting Over It is great because it brought outsider art to the masses in a respectful way. But it&amp;apos;s still worth experiencing the original, since there are some aspects that can&amp;apos;t be polished without losing something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BF:&lt;/strong&gt; People also talk very fondly about his Star Wars Episode VII, but it&amp;#x2019;s not online anymore and I haven&amp;apos;t tried it. I recommend his other &amp;apos;Sexy&amp;apos; game, Sexy Hand II, which is a golf game with a similarly unusual control scheme, and GM Golf which is like a fusion of Sexy Hiking and Sexy Hand. He made games that were completely unconnected to this series, but personally I think his experimentation with mouse controls led to the most timeless work.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star Wars Episode VII, by Jazzuo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bennett, how did those students at NYU react to Sexy Hiking? And what is it you hope they get out of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BF:&lt;/strong&gt; They reacted in much the same way as indie developers did in 2007&amp;#x2014;they were polarized. Some of them became angry at it and refused to continue playing it, a few were captivated by it. I have showed so many old games to students, and honestly usually they can only take a dry academic interest because norms of user interaction and game design have moved on so much from the 80s and 90s. If they get really engaged in playing a game for enjoyment you know it must be timeless. Those games are really in the minority&amp;#x2026; obviously people still enjoy Mario and Mega Man, but it&amp;apos;s a real joy to me if I can find timeless games that American students are entirely unaware of: Alexei Pajitnov&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/shawl" target="_blank"&gt;Shawl&lt;/a&gt;, David Braben&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarch" target="_blank"&gt;Zarch&lt;/a&gt;, Mike Singleton&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-21-dream-a-little-bigger-the-legacy-of-mike-singleton" target="_blank"&gt;Lords of Midnight&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elasto Mania, by Bal  zs R  zsa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it about Sexy Hiking in particular that appealed to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BF&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;apos;m a big fan of messy, realtime physics puzzle games, going back to &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-a-17-year-old-community-is-keeping-elasto-mania-alive/" target="_blank"&gt;Elasto Mania&lt;/a&gt; (the original Trials physics game) and &lt;a href="https://www.fun-motion.com/physics-games/ski-stunt-simulator/" target="_blank"&gt;Ski Stunt Simulator&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;apos;s a huge area of inspiration in my own work. But more than that Sexy Hiking just makes a very arresting first impression; there&amp;apos;s something really unusual about how it looks, even though the quality is very low. I&amp;apos;m a big believer in the power of games that have an original and powerful &amp;apos;first screenshot&amp;apos;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes people who make B-movies end up becoming almost folk heroes, like Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau, but that doesn&amp;apos;t seem to happen in games. We don&amp;apos;t have the same appreciation for B-games we have for B-movies. Why do you think that is?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the other god of B-game development from Jazzuo's period is MDickie, whose magnum opus is The You Testament, a game about Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Bennett Foddy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DY:&lt;/strong&gt; Videogames are still young compared to movies and it takes time to foster that kind of appreciation. But Jazzuo is certainly a folk hero to a lot of people in the indie game community and there&amp;apos;s a YouTube video of someone beating Sexy Hiking which has over 128,000 views as I&amp;apos;m writing this. Hopefully Getting Over It will keep bringing him to people&amp;apos;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BF:&lt;/strong&gt; Culturally we just don&amp;apos;t recognize the individuals who make games, even in the cases of solo-authored games. Of course there are exceptions, like Jonathan Blow or the great Japanese auteur designers, but generally game reviews and previews don&amp;apos;t talk at all about the designers, game players don&amp;apos;t know who the designers are, and game designers work actively to make sure their identities are invisible in their games and sometimes even in the credits. This is one of the main reasons I decided to insert myself in Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jazzuo&amp;apos;s a bit of an enigma, having disappeared from games entirely. Would you like to follow in his footsteps some day, just move on and leave a baffling legacy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BF:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, times are different, and I have given enough interviews now that I think people would have a pretty good idea of who I was and what I was trying to do, if I suddenly broke contact and moved to the mountains. But no, I hope to potter along making games, most of which will be pretty unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DY:&lt;/strong&gt; I plan on staying in games for a long time, but I understand wanting to dissociate from the industry at times. I try to only read and interact with the parts of gaming that are positive for me mentally. I realize that I&amp;apos;m fortunate to be able to do so&amp;#x2014;not everyone has that luxury. A baffling legacy sounds awesome, though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;The You Testament, by MDickie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some other B-games you think are interesting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BF:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the other god of B-game development from Jazzuo&amp;apos;s period is MDickie, whose magnum opus is &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/crap-shoot-the-you-testamen" target="_blank"&gt;The You Testament&lt;/a&gt;, a game about Jesus. Other than that, well&amp;#x2026; B-game is a pretty loosely defined term, which blends into other groupings like &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusoge" target="_blank"&gt;kusoge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, and I think the heart of it is games that are deliberately unpolished. I love Pajitnov and Pokhilko&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/magnetic-crane" target="_blank"&gt;Magnetic Crane&lt;/a&gt; from 1989, but it predates developers who thought of themselves as making B-games. I like that Cactus game &lt;a href="http://cactusquid.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/dungeon.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, and Messhof&amp;apos;s game &lt;a href="http://cargocollective.com/messhof/You-Found-The-Grappling-Hook" target="_blank"&gt;You Found the Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt;. I love the Japanese B-Game &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMIwpFwZCN8" target="_blank"&gt;Super Panda Ball&lt;/a&gt;, kind of like a B-game version of Zany Golf. And I guess even though it costs money, we could also count Justin Smith&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://captaingames.itch.io/rsss" target="_blank"&gt;Realistic Summer Sports Simulator&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite games of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DY:&lt;/strong&gt; I highly recommend checking out the work of Ikiki, MDickie, and thecatamites. If I had to pick a game from each to try first, it would be &lt;a href="https://www.tigsource.com/2007/06/11/nikujin/" target="_blank"&gt;Nikujin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mdickie.com/prev_hardtime.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Hard Time&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/space-funeral/3492" target="_blank"&gt;Space Funeral&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Ikiki&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://www.tigsource.com/2007/06/14/hakaiman/" target="_blank"&gt;Hakaiman&lt;/a&gt; is also great and was a major inspiration for Hotline Miami.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394102381815455359</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 22:45:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The best and worst boss fights in PC gaming</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2394102381815165303</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN, Undertale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boss fights are great. Except when they&amp;apos;re terrible! &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/boss-fights-good-or-bad/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Things got heated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when the PC Gamer staff debated whether the boss fight is good design or an antiquated videogame trope, so we decided to present our strongest evidence for each case. First up: a collection of our favorite bosses, the battles that have stuck with us for years. On page two, the list of shame: a whole bunch of bad, stupid bosses we hated fighting but love talking shit about. They all deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Master, Fallout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jody: &lt;/strong&gt;I&amp;apos;ve finished Fallout twice and never defeated The Master by just straight-up shooting him in the eyes or whatever other bits he has&amp;#x2014;he&amp;apos;s a mutant lump of flesh so unfathomable if you try for an aimed shot half of him is just labeled &amp;quot;???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I made it to the end of Fallout it was with a sneaky, high-agility character who stealthed around his base and set off a nuke in it. The second time it was with a diplomatic, high-charisma type who talked the Master to death, choosing conversation options that exposed his flawed philosophy, made him realize his own monstrosity, and led him to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;apos;s an option to just attack if you want to take the Master on with pulse grenades and a real big gun if that&amp;apos;s your thing, but the fact you don&amp;apos;t have to is what makes the climax of Fallout so great. Plenty of people hate bosses, so making them optional seems like such an obvious kindness it&amp;apos;s baffling that 21 years later it&amp;apos;s still uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Argus mech, Vanquish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese videogames have been chasing what I&amp;apos;ll call the Macross Aesthetic for decades: an overwhelming, awe-inspiring flurry of missiles crisscrossing the sky, white smoke arcing behind them. For years this was mainly a thing in 2D games: bullet hell SHMUPs and the incredible &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWht7Eq9fEQ"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangai-o&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Vanquish&amp;apos;s Argus mech, while a pretty straightforward &amp;quot;shoot the weak point&amp;quot; battle, is one of my favorite boss fights of all time because it completely delivers on the promise of translating the Macross missile explosion into 3D. And it looks unbelievably cool doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deal the Argus mech enough damage, and it&amp;apos;ll stop firing at you with its cannon to unleash a volley of hundreds of missiles. It&amp;apos;s a stunning moment, but it&amp;apos;s also a perfect embodiment of what Vanquish is as a game. It&amp;apos;s a melding of over-the-top, distinctly anime Japanese action with the conventions of an American third-person shooter. In other words, there&amp;apos;s a cliche, gruff American antihero, but he wears power armor and kicks giant missile-spewing mechs so hard they explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Artorias of the Abyss, Dark Souls&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin: &lt;/strong&gt;Artorias of the Abyss reads like a Dark Souls boss. He&amp;apos;s a tragic figure both emblematic of and integral to the overarching story of the Abyss DLC, and he&amp;apos;s characterized through NPC dialogue and descriptions embedded in weapons and armor. You don&amp;apos;t want to kill him, but he&amp;apos;s too far gone and you have no choice. That&amp;apos;s classic Dark Souls. But at the same time, he doesn&amp;apos;t &lt;em&gt;feel &lt;/em&gt;like a Dark Souls boss, and that&amp;apos;s what makes him so great.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the bosses in the original game are slow, lumbering monsters that you fight by nipping at their heels until they fall over. Artorias is the total opposite. He&amp;apos;s a relatively small but still incredibly imposing knight, and he moves wildly and quickly. His form and figure have been distorted by the abyss, but he&amp;apos;s still got the moves. You spend the entire game plinking away at behemoths in the 19 seconds it takes them to wind up an attack, and here comes Artorias with some freakin&amp;apos; front-flips. He fights like you, the player. He rolls like you, swings like you, retreats like you. He&amp;apos;s a refreshing, relentless wake-up call who gives you zero breathing room and feels like a Bloodborne or Dark Souls 3 boss, and I wouldn&amp;apos;t have it any other way.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0VJ0Ub8fXA"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jubileus, The Creator, Bayonetta&amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin:&lt;/strong&gt; How else could a game as stylish and over-the-top as Bayonetta end if not in a galactic punchup? At this point in the game, you&amp;apos;re picking basic enemies out of your teeth and scraping titan-sized mini-bosses off your heels. Then Jubileus, the biggest of the big bads, descends from on high with a dozen health bars and multiple forms just askin&amp;apos; for an ass-kickin&amp;apos;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jubileus is cleaner and more varied than most giant bosses, which have a tendency to play themselves. She has several distinct forms with unique attacks that expose cleverly placed weak points, and she gets better and better as you whittle her down. The level around you changes. Different weapons excel at damaging certain parts. It&amp;apos;s a long fight but it earns its runtime, and Jeanne&amp;apos;s role as partner manages to tie a climactic bow on the game&amp;apos;s otherwise tangled story.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;apos;s a great &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; boss too, a delicious mix of everything Bayonetta does right: bonkers vehicle sections, short and forgiving quick-time events, dramatic camera angles and, of course, unforgettable finishers. I can think of no better way to send off one of Platinum Games&amp;apos; finest than pile-driving a god into the sun.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flowey, Undertale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes Fenlon: &lt;/strong&gt;What a hell of an ending. Undertale is a game that constantly upsets your expectations, but its final boss&amp;#x2014;not exactly the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; final boss, but that&amp;apos;s part of what makes the encounter so good&amp;#x2014;breaks away from Undertale&amp;apos;s aesthetic, and really from its reality. The fight tears at the structure of the game, making you survive an intense gauntlet, tempting you again and again to break from pacifism, before finally setting you up to play through parts of Undertale again to see the true ending. That ultimate battle is more emotionally affecting, but the first encounter with Flowey is where Undertale truly shows off how brilliantly it can execute on its meta ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHDPr07hyzs"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough, Dark Souls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe: &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#xA0;I&amp;apos;ve killed Gwyn loads of times. I&amp;apos;ve both lit and walked away from the final bonfire. I&amp;apos;ve tackled Lordran&amp;apos;s brilliantly designed world in multiple configurations. I&amp;apos;ve watched countless walkthroughs and let&amp;apos;s plays. And yet no matter how many times I complete From Software&amp;apos;s gothic action role-player Dark Souls, I can never,&lt;em&gt; ever&lt;/em&gt;, beat Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough on my first attempt without the help of Solaire.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I love it. I love the anticipation of trekking through Anor Londo, and stocking up for the big fight. I love swapping polite exchanges with the Giant Blacksmith as I upgrade my lightning halberd. I love grinding out a few extra souls levels with the Royal Sentinels that guard the boss arena. I love concocting an ill-conceived strategy in my head beforehand. I love saying to myself: &amp;quot;This is it. This is the moment I finally defeat these bastards first time without the help of the sunbro&amp;quot;, before inevitably peeling my splattered face from the forum&amp;apos;s floor thereafter.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, no matter how many times I&amp;apos;m floored by Ornstein and Smough, the fact that I&amp;apos;m yet to topple them on my lonesome gives me an excuse to return to one of my favourite games. With two hulking baddies&amp;#x2014;and one final form nemesis&amp;#x2014;this fight&amp;apos;s scope for change and incidental moments makes it, for me at least, near impossible to predict. It&amp;apos;s fast, it&amp;apos;s frantic, and no matter how many tries it takes, I&amp;apos;m yet to feel a similar sense of accomplishment from any other game.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Dark Souls Remastered is just around the corner too. We go again, boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mr Freeze, Batman: Arkham City&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel: &lt;/strong&gt;The bosses in the Arkham series are uneven, but the second game showed considerable progress over the first, which mostly featured repetitive encounters with larger enemies. Mr Freeze is a smartly-designed battle, letting the player use each technique at Batman&amp;apos;s disposal once&amp;#x2014;electricity, explosives and so on&amp;#x2014;before Victor Fries remembers that method and it can&amp;apos;t be repeated.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse than that, he&amp;apos;s iced up the gargoyles so there&amp;apos;s no hiding from him above, which is a key part of your arsenal when trying to play Arkham stealthily. You&amp;apos;re stuck on the ground with Mr Freeze as he stalks you. A former colleague of mine compared it to a great Metal Gear boss fight, and he&amp;apos;s right&amp;#x2014;it&amp;apos;s similarly tricksy and demands clever thinking from the player. &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MpxrkbVZwHY"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monster Zoo, Dungeons of Dredmor&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#xA0;Can a room be a boss? I submit that a room can be a boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZU0g7edxuI"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#xA0;Jack Krauser, Resident Evil 4&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel: &lt;/strong&gt;Resident Evil 4 is one of very few games that gets away with QTEs, which have mostly died out in games over the past decade. Leon&amp;apos;s knife fight with Krauser is mostly cutscene-led, but it&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZU0g7edxuI"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a great example of the form&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2014;a tense sequence where you finally get to see the two characters face off.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boss fight proper is great too, set in a maze of ruins where he&amp;apos;ll run at you with a knife, and it later escalates to a final battle on a precarious platform as Krauser mutates. Sometimes this encounter will transition into a QTE knife fight in-game, too, which is a nice touch. Resident Evil 4&amp;apos;s story is hokey but fun, and while you&amp;apos;re never quite emotionally invested, it&amp;apos;s fun to take the journey. You wait a long time to see Leon and Krauser finally face off, and the battle is exciting, over-the-top and even cinematic&amp;#x2014;it&amp;apos;s Resident Evil 4 at its best.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Transcendent One, Planescape: Torment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest failings of boss fights is how often they abandon the principles of the game they&amp;apos;re in, robbing you of agency or creativity in favor of a big arena slugfest or fancy cinematic. The opposite of that is Planescape: Torment, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/" target="_blank"&gt;maybe the best RPG of all time&lt;/a&gt;, which utterly commits to letting you talk your way out of conflict, up until the very end. There are a number of ways your encounter with The Transcendent One can end, including combat if that&amp;apos;s your wish. But dialogue, as always in Planescape, proves to be the more interesting option. Gaming rarely manages to get this philosophical, and even more rarely pulls it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twisted Marionette, Guild Wars 2&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil:&lt;/strong&gt; The Twisted Marionette was available for about a month during Guild Wars 2&amp;apos;s first update season. You can&amp;apos;t fight it anymore&amp;#x2014;you haven&amp;apos;t been able to fight it for over four years&amp;#x2014;but I still think it&amp;apos;s one of the best bosses I&amp;apos;ve defeated. Rather than an instanced encounter, the Marionette was an open world event that triggered every two hours. Players on the map would have to organise themselves into five lanes of (if you were lucky) around 25 players each. The fight had two main phases. The bulk of your time was spent in your lane, defending against waves of enemies. In addition, each lane took turns in the central chamber, where they were distributed across five mini-arenas&amp;#x2014;each with a Champion to defeat. Succeed, and one of the Marionette&amp;apos;s chains was cut. Fail, and you were one step closer to annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If each lane succeeded, the battle was won and the Marionette would collapse. It felt elegant&amp;#x2014;requiring more coordination than just chipping away at a big monster&amp;apos;s health, but not so much that only the most hardcore servers had a shot of bringing it down. There was an arc&amp;#x2014;our server spent days unable to make the kill, but slowly started to refine our approach. We failed loads, but the process of learning, optimisation and eventually overcoming the challenge remains one of my favourite journeys within the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a  target="_blank"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via Speciesgame.com forums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aquifers, Dwarf Fortress&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes Fenlon: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, goblins and elves and running out of booze are all bad news. But the truest enemy of any fortress builder is the mighty aquifer, an underground water source that can quickly and brutally flood your fortress if you don&amp;apos;t know how to deal with it. There&amp;apos;s an entire &lt;a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Aquifer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dwarf Fortress wiki page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; devoted to aquifers and the strategies for defeating them. That&amp;apos;s a boss fight if I&amp;apos;ve ever seen one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Giant Terminator Baby, Mass Effect 2&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes: &lt;/strong&gt;I&amp;apos;m not even going to dignify Mass Effect 2&amp;apos;s final boss with its proper name, such was its stupidity. The first Mass Effect culminated with a battle against an imposing, badass rogue agent whose role turns out to be more nuanced than pure evil, followed by a series of dramatic decisions that affected the fate of the Citadel. It was the perfect mix of action and roleplaying, exactly what Mass Effect should be. The second game, despite the overall brilliance of its suicide run final mission, decided to end with the equivalent of a Contra boss battle. A Contra boss battle that was too easy and looked absolutely ridiculous. When people complain about Mass Effect becoming too much of an action series, this fight is exhibit A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivEih3gCdtU"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Arkham Knight drill fight, Batman: Arkham Knight&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jody: &lt;/strong&gt;The Arkham games had a couple of decent boss fights, but way more bad ones. They loved the kind where you have to lure some jacked-up beefy boy into charging, then dodge so he hits a wall instead. Arkham Knight managed to do the most drawn-out version of this, because you have to drive the goddamn Bat-Tank at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arkham Knight attacks in the tunnels under Gotham, driving a digger drill like he&amp;apos;s a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYepXKaS8YQ"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bananaman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; villain. You have to lure him into sections wired with explosives, avoiding barriers and spinning fan blades, repeating this for what is probably just shy of 10 minutes but feels like hours. Meanwhile he shouts bland taunts like &amp;quot;You can&amp;apos;t hide!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ll find you!&amp;quot; to remind you that, after two games of Mark Hamill&amp;apos;s excellent Joker, now you&amp;apos;re up against a man who smolders with generic rage. I like the Arkham games, but they&amp;apos;re textbook examples of why 90 percent of boss fights could be dropped to no great loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via Gameranx.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zerst&amp;#xF6;rer Robots, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin: &lt;/strong&gt;I&amp;apos;m generally a boss fight proponent, but Wolfenstein 2&amp;apos;s Zerst&amp;#xF6;rer Robots make a good case for cancelling bosses entirely. They simultaneously lack everything that makes Wolf 2 fun&amp;#x2014;multiple methods of approach, creative sightlines, playing execution leapfrog, satisfying feedback on kills&amp;#x2014;and exacerbate its biggest problems, like the way it sucks at telling you when you&amp;apos;re taking damage and where it&amp;apos;s coming from. &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These robots have so much health and deal so much damage that you have no choice but to clear out the H-shaped airship you fight them on and take potshots from the interior tunnels, alternating exits each time. On higher difficulties at least, fighting them is a slow, repetitive process that isn&amp;apos;t even in the same hemisphere as fun. I played through the entire game a few notches above normal difficulty and loved the added challenge, but these piles of junk were so dragging and infuriating that I spitefully cranked the difficulty to easy just to get past them. And I&amp;apos;d do it again.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Alma, F.E.A.R. 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes: &lt;/strong&gt;What a piece of shit ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ghaul, Destiny 2&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin: &lt;/strong&gt;The final fight against Ghaul, leader of the Cabal&amp;apos;s Red Legion and the Darth Vader walrus-thing who destroyed the Tower, is a disappointment not just because of what is, but because of what it is not.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is&lt;/em&gt; a run-of-the-mill arena fight against a glorified Cabal Centurion. Ghaul himself is just a health bar with some knock-off powers. He&amp;apos;s removed from the fight most of the time, and whenever he does raise his ugly head you just one-shot him with your constantly refilled super. You spend more time fighting the basic enemies scattered around the ship, and doing so never feels climactic because the arena is boring, they&amp;apos;re the same old enemies and there aren&amp;apos;t even that many. Like, this is it, Red Legion. We are on your flagship. This is the final battle. The least you could do is bring the A-team.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the true misery of the fight is the cutscene that follows, in which Ghaul transforms into a much more interesting-looking plasma phantom and soars up to the Traveler. At this point, I&amp;#x2014;and by I, I mean everyone except the folks at Bungie apparently&amp;#x2014;thought, &amp;quot;Awesome, we get to kill him for real in the raid.&amp;quot; But no. He just melts right there, so instead we fight some random fat dude in the raid. Destiny YouTuber Datto said it best: &amp;quot;I want to fight the big thing.&amp;quot; Destiny 2 doesn&amp;apos;t let you fight the big thing, and that&amp;apos;s a bummer.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pinwheel, Dark Souls&amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://darksouls.wikidot.com/pinwheel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to this Dark Souls wiki&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pinwheel is: &amp;quot;A flying, multi-masked necromancer who stole the power of the Gravelord and reigns over the Catacombs. [It] spawns multiple copies of itself and attacks the player with projectile blasts.&amp;quot; All of which sounds pretty badass, right? Except in practice it&amp;apos;s not really like that. At all.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a game that prides itself on its challenging encounters, Pinwheel is an anomaly. This run in is not only easier than every other boss battle in Dark Souls, it&amp;apos;s easier than a fair whack of its standard enemies too. Its moveset is predictable, its cloned subordinates are a pain, and its drops&amp;#x2014;bar the Rite of Kindling&amp;#x2014;are rubbish. I almost lost the plot after my umpteenth death at the hands of Ornstein and Smough&amp;#x2014;yet the feeling of finally besting them was second to none. Pinwheel, on the other hand, robbed me of that eureka feeling by being so damn weak.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/155u5t/this_explains_why_pinwheel_is_so_easy/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The suggestion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that From Software expected players to invade the Catacombs early on goes a ways to explaining why Pinwheel in so underpowered later in the game, but the Catacombs itself is surely no place for pre-Anor Londo/Sen&amp;apos;s Fortress/Blighttown players. In any event, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/this-dark-souls-mod-relocates-bonfires-npcs-enemies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FTRichter&amp;#x2019;s Prepare to Die Again mod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reimagines a more formidable Pinwheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via visualwalkthroughs.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fontaine, Bioshock&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes: &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s terrible. You have this great game, and then you end up fighting this giant nude dude. We didn&amp;apos;t have a better idea,&amp;quot; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/inside-bioshock-video-game-series-with-ken-levine-w439921"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ken Levine once said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Well-put. Bioshock&amp;apos;s final battle ditched everything brilliant about the game to end with a cliche slugfest with a big muscular guy. The game clearly didn&amp;apos;t quite know where to go after the encounter with Andrew Ryan, but it definitely should&amp;apos;ve gone &lt;em&gt;somewhere else&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe force the player to sit through a reading of John Galt&amp;apos;s 80 page monologue from Atlas Shrugged? That would&amp;apos;ve been a better tonal fit, and a far greater challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2n7_DSEAJA"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eli, Metal Gear Solid 5&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel: &lt;/strong&gt;Hot damn, I hated this scrap with baby Liquid Snake where you couldn&amp;apos;t just use deadly weapons against him and be done with it. Fair enough, he&amp;apos;s a kid, but he&amp;apos;ll grow up to cause such trouble, what with the walking nuclear robots and inhabiting the mind of a man dressed &lt;a href="http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Revolver_Ocelot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a bit like a cowboy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, you need to chase him around a beached ship until you can knock him out. And at that point, you&amp;apos;re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; ready to do so.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid 5 are that great, unfortunately, which is a shame for a series that has produced so many great ones in the past. MGS and MGS2, which both came to PC ages ago, have a slightly better hit rate, with the likes of Gray Fox in the former and Vamp in the latter. Luckily, The Phantom Pain is great at just about everything else.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BG9WVZ7zmog"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vaas, Far Cry 3&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris: &lt;/strong&gt;There&amp;apos;s a lot of bad boss fights in the Far Cry series, so it&amp;apos;s hard to pick just one. I&amp;apos;m going with Vaas because he&amp;apos;s probably the most enjoyable and memorable character in the series, and thus the crappy boss fight stings more than others because he frankly deserved a better sendoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a satisfying boss fight in a game where you&amp;apos;re essentially a superhero bristling with weapons and capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of damage yourself&amp;#x2026; it&amp;apos;s a challenge, really, because &lt;em&gt;you&amp;apos;re &lt;/em&gt;a damn boss. So, Ubisoft does what it always does when it&amp;apos;s painted itself into a corner: stuffs you full of drugs and makes you hallucinate. Welcome to a gloomy netherworld corridor paved with TV screens (for some reason) where Vaas after Vaas after Vaas run at you, die from a single bullet, and disappear into a puff of smoke. It&amp;apos;s not a test of endurance and skill, just patience. When every ghost Vaas is dead you get a cutscene where you do a cool hand-switching knife move that you can&amp;apos;t actually do in the game, then you watch him expire. You&amp;apos;re left with nothing other than a sense of disappointment and the sad fact that you&amp;apos;re still Jason Brody.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394102381815165303</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 20:50:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stardew Valley multiplayer could be ready in about a month </title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2394102381814282907</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Stardew Valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited cooperative multiplayer mode is still on course to hit &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/stardew-valley/"&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/a&gt; soon, going by what creator Eric &amp;#8220;ConcernedApe&amp;#8221; Barone has tapped out on the tweetosphere. Following &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/15/stardew-valleys-multiplayer-beta-expected-for-spring/"&gt;February&amp;#8217;s word&lt;/a&gt; that it was entering testing, Barone last night &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/983762007466770433"&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; the update: &amp;#8220;still making good progress on fixing bugs, if all goes well it should be ready in about a month&amp;#8221; on PC. Good, good. The plan had been to enter beta testing in spring and hell, I&amp;#8217;m not sure we&amp;#8217;ve even left winter yet. &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/04/11/stardew-valley-multiplayer-ready-in-about-a-month/#more-533789" class="more-link"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/04/steam.jpg" title="Steaming." width="620" height="310" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-533775" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve have &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1667896941884942467"&gt;overhauled&lt;/a&gt; the privacy settings for Steam user profiles, letting us hide more data and setting more of it to be hidden from strangers by default &amp;#8211; including the list of games you own. Good. More online platforms should default to hiding personal data. We can now hide our playtime on games if we want too, so our pals can e.g. see that we own The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth but not that we&amp;#8217;ve played it for e.g. 871 hours, in case we feel e.g. shame about that (not me: I&amp;#8217;ll tell you it&amp;#8217;s just that good).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does have the knock-on effect of locking out Steam Spy, the popular non-Valve site which scans vast numbers of public profiles to estimate how many people own a game and how much they play it. In a secretive industry, it&amp;#8217;s one of the few ways to have a sense of how well a game is doing. &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/04/11/steam-privacy-changes-block-steamspy/#more-533653" class="more-link"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNLzJuwKHFE"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overkill&amp;#x2019;s long-delayed but soon-to-appear cooperative zombie romp has been on the go for long enough so that someone really should have come up with a better name, one that won&amp;#x2019;t be confused with Telltale&amp;#x2019;s The Walking Dead. But maybe this is all part of the brand. AMC&amp;#x2019;s The Walking Dead, Telltale&amp;#x2019;s The Walking Dead, Overkill&amp;#x2019;s The Walking Dead. Before long we&amp;#x2019;ll all own a slice of the pie.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway! There&amp;#x2019;s a new trailer out, introducing one of the playable survivors, Maya. Her zombie apocalypse origin story is your typical slice of unrelenting misery porn. She gets stuck at work&amp;#x2014;we&amp;#x2019;ve all been there&amp;#x2014;when the undead attack, leading her and another doctor to fight back-to-back, struggling to survive against a tide of pesky cadavers. But oh no! Her friend gets bitten. We know how it goes from there.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maya&amp;#x2019;s spotlight is the second of two reveals so far. Her pal Aidan&amp;#x2019;s trailer is much more upbeat, however. Only kidding! It&amp;#x2019;s also very bleak.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/non_0jlOXew"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/overkills-the-walking-dead-confirmed-for-2016/"&gt;Two years of delays&lt;/a&gt; have tempered my enthusiasm, but unless Valve announces Left 4 Dead 3, Overkill&amp;#x2019;s The Walking Dead still might fill a big gap. It&amp;#x2019;s also a 4-player co-op FPS, though it introduces a base camp that can be protected and filled with supplies and survivors, too. And like Overkill&amp;#x2019;s other co-op FPS, Payday, each character comes with their own skill trees and roles.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walking Dead is due out this autumn.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394102381813815236</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 11:50:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Learning to walk (and work) again in Stardew Valley</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2394102381811910408</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for Stardew Valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a warm October night, I woke to find my leg felt like it was on fire. My ability to walk around had been deteriorating for the last month, to the point of being sent home from work. Eventually getting out of bed had become a herculean task, my knee swollen to unnatural size, and my back locking up at the slightest motion. At the unusually young age of 25, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disorder that aggressively attacks the body&amp;apos;s joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though my doctors have told me I&amp;apos;ll recover with time, the past months have been an excruciating reevaluation of how I spend that time, and how much I took for granted the ability to hop from task to task. Unable to walk unassisted or return to my day job for the better part of a month, I fell into depression, lamenting my inability to focus on my work or the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until, that is, I visited the rolling pastures and shimmering beaches of Stardew Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its rows of corn, baby chickens, and charming librarians to woo, Stardew Valley has uniquely tapped into the sense of pride that comes with a hard day&amp;apos;s&amp;#x2014;and a hard year&amp;apos;s&amp;#x2014;work. From the opening moments as you flee your dreary office job for the untamed fields of your late grandfather&amp;apos;s farm, Stardew Valley pins all your hopes and dreams on your willingness to work slowly towards a goal, one step at a time. It&amp;apos;s been instrumental in recentering my drive to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the smartest thing the game does is push you out that cabin door with almost zero guidance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve never been one for life simulators. The warm charm of early Harvest Moons couldn&amp;apos;t capture my Pokemon-obsessed attention, I enjoyed visiting friend&amp;apos;s homes in The Sims more than making my own, and the anthropomorphic debt collectors of Animal Crossing couldn&amp;apos;t sell me on a new mortgage. Why play out a normal life when you can live a high-flying fantasy? It&amp;apos;s an easy perspective to have, until your sense of normality is threatened or outright taken from you. Suddenly, the ability to build the ideal living space or the ideal routine is as much a fantasy as hunting robot dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;apos;s see if this sounds familiar. It&amp;apos;s 6 a.m. and time to hop out of bed. You take a minute to check the weather, step out, breathe in the air, and then it&amp;apos;s off to your daily tasks. There&amp;apos;s the matter of what to do with your afternoon, but for now, those rows of tomatoes need watering, your chickens need feeding, and those eggs aren&amp;apos;t going to magically transform into mayonnaise themselves. As much as Stardew Valley&amp;apos;s activities are farm-based, its most universal diversion may be the moment you just stand on your porch, thinking of how much you can cram into the day&amp;apos;s schedule.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;apos;s one thing real life has over Stardew Valley&amp;apos;s small-town charm, it&amp;apos;s that my doctor is infinitely more available. But for those first few weeks, even my regular physician was stumped by my rapidly expanding kneecap. With my family insurance only covering one busy rheumatologist, the following weeks were a torturous blend of waiting, uncertainty, experimentation, and more waiting. After my leg was drained of inflammatory fluid, I was ordered two weeks off work&amp;#x2014;which only gave more time for aimless thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;m sure the protagonist of Stardew Valley had their share of questions (both actual and existential) when they first arrived. A new stage of life, unfamiliar tools, and a feeling that nothing will ever be quite the same again. Perhaps the smartest thing the game does is push you out that cabin door with almost zero guidance. There&amp;apos;s the occasional letter from a neighbor, but other than that it&amp;apos;s on you to learn the steps to grow and maintain an entire farm, to say nothing of integrating into Stardew&amp;apos;s tight-knit community.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after my diagnosis, and with the direction of a trained specialist, I still felt that uncertainty and inexperience gnawing at me. What does my immediate and long-term future look like? How will the medicine and tools given to me impact my physical and mental health? Is this something I&amp;apos;ll have to worry about forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like Stardew Valley&amp;apos;s protagonist, I&amp;apos;ve come to find comfort in the small gains I make each day. In planting rows of corn I&amp;apos;m strapping myself in for one of the game&amp;apos;s lengthier waiting periods. At times, it can feel like the plants are mocking me, barely growing over the course of 24 hours. But after 14 long days of labor, I finally have these majestic stalks of gold. Since my social pursuits mainly consist of fawning over Penny the redhead tutor, I also grow a small grouping of poppy flowers just for her birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stardew Valley reminds me that the most meaningful goals are things you have to wholly dedicate yourself to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many days, though, it&amp;apos;s not about some great payoff. Sometimes you just need to chop wood and chisel stone until you can&amp;apos;t anymore. Stardew takes it one step further with your energy meter, forcing you to calculate just how much you&amp;apos;ll need to save to make it home from your fishing trip. Any kind of personal upkeep is like that, really, laced with days and days of menial, repetitive actions meant to keep a simple wheel turning, hopefully with enough foresight to account for tomorrow&amp;apos;s work. From time to time I still need to remind myself that I&amp;apos;m not quite the semi-invincible man I once was, bounding upstairs for a fourth time because I forgot my keys or hustling from customer to customer at my day job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stardew Valley&amp;apos;s cycle of honest living has become my (hopefully temporary) fantasy, but it&amp;apos;s also grounded me in reality in a way no game had the chance to before. The thrill I get from hiking into town for the annual festival or exploring the beaches for treasure&amp;#x2014;simply moving about my day at an energetic pace&amp;#x2014;is one that still feels like something I can eventually return to in real life. And sure, those fantasies are something that can explored in any game with a wide enough world to journey through, but coupled with my responsibilities as a caretaker of self and soil, Stardew Valley reminds me that the most meaningful goals are things you have to wholly dedicate yourself to, even when their fruits are but bumps in the earth.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seed becomes a farm, an unexpected encounter becomes a loving bond, and with enough work, an injury becomes a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394102381811910408</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 23:12:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stardew Valley's multiplayer update "should be ready in about a month"</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/eurogamer/2394101748817906984</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/b&gt; for Stardew Valley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stardew Valley multiplayer could be finished as early as next month, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/983762007466770433" target="_blank"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from creator Eric Barone. &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-multiplayer-update-is-in-qa-beta-expected-in-spring/" target="_blank"&gt;In February,&lt;/a&gt; publisher Chucklefish said the multiplayer update has entered QA testing. &amp;quot;Work on the new features is done, and we&amp;#x2019;ve sent all the new text off to be translated into the different languages,&amp;quot; Barone said at the time, adding that a public beta should be available for spring, which is consistent with today&amp;apos;s update.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank"&gt;you can play modded multiplayer right now.&lt;/a&gt; It just takes a little elbow grease.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2394101748817372559</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 18:12:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Wormhole Wars is the Portal arena deathmatch of your dreams</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2394101748809080591</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Portal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every game needs to reinvent the wheel. Or even involve themselves in this business of wheels. Sometimes you need only grab a few universally beloved things and jam them together. If you had an arena multiplayer shooter that combined the best levels of Halo with the constant world-bending of Portal and added a dash of the best parts of Overwatch, well, that&amp;#8217;s what &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/wormhole-wars"&gt;Wormhole Wars&lt;/a&gt; looks like it wants to be. And that&amp;#8217;s what I want it to be too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Hello,&lt;br /&gt;since 0.16 is stable we can assign more of our effort into the work on 0.17. One of those features planned for that release is the Rich &amp;amp; interactive text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having more text formatting options was one of the things we wanted for quite some time, and it is finally starting to become reality in the 0.17 branch.The initial motivation was to have more possibilities in the tutorial related texts, but it proved to be useful having it available globally in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current format for any text markup we use is [&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;], but it might change somehow before 0.17 hits the public. This feature is being developed by wheybags, and it is progressing forward quite steadily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Basic text formating - font and color&lt;/h2&gt;The obvious option is to allow changing text color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/b6e7080d3b90b681d82b36b3cf2e94136a1860f8.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and to allow to change font:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/c8c572e4111fbf452b4fd6d7f49182821a1b199e.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images - icons&lt;/h2&gt;Since we already have a system to specify icons by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/Concepts.html#SpritePath"&gt;SpritePath&lt;/a&gt;, we can use it as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/61696aba705e6f0166bdea8d3e6c6930e7b19ae9.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about this, is that all these concepts work on basically all places where text is used, so you can use it in the station name for example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/fa36a0e30a31760cfdfa9f39d7a45944f8eca28c.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or even save names (although, I needed to add a possibility to use &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; in sprite path resolution to make it possible):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/1d2746549bf42a83c8e301e12545747f3d37948d.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or blueprint names:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/1d2746549bf42a83c8e301e12545747f3d37948d.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Element references&lt;/h2&gt;The next planned step will be to make it possible to allow this not only to be used as icons, but as references to the actual items, so the syntax would be something like:[item=straight-rail] or [recipe=advanced-oil-processing]. When used in the chat, it should allow the reader to hover over the icon and get a tooltip of the corresponding game element. When used with technology, it could allow the user to open the mentioned technology by clicking the reference icon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More advanced usages&lt;/h2&gt;This brings us to the more advanced possibilities, like linking a map position as a clickable icon in the text (something like [gps=&amp;lt;position&amp;gt;]), referencing your armor, so other&amp;#39;s can just hover it in the text and see it. Specifying target to specific train you want to mention and mainly, being able to reference blueprints this way, something like [blueprint=&amp;lt;blueprint string&amp;gt;] can you to show some specific setup in a chat, and others could be able to get the blueprint by just clicking on the icon if they want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be quite curious to see what other type of usages of this can you come up with, let us know on the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/59401"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2394101748802709681</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:55:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Unknown Pleasures: A doughty dozen new Steam games</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2394101748802740222</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Steam&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/unknown-pleasures/"&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/a&gt; has been on unplanned hiatus as I have been grotesquely ill. The lack of communication or cover was entirely my fault, and I apologise for that unreservedly (and extend further thanks to the Hivemind for their extraordinary patience). I&amp;#8217;m sorry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, hang on, Adam&amp;#8217;s leaving. I can blame him! It was Adam, everyone! Shake your indignant fists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a bumper of 12 games this week, and then we&amp;#8217;ll be back to normal.  So, assaulting our ailing bodies this week: third party candidates, pugilistic ducks, and a JRPG that wait where are you going no come on, be fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steam Machines went nowhere, Valve have basically said (I&amp;#8217;m paraphrasing a touch), but nah, don&amp;#8217;t sweat it, they are still committed to improving gaming on Linux. After shuffling Steam Machines deeper into the labyrinth of Steam&amp;#8217;s website menus, and the ensuing cybersquawking over Valve having done a thing, they&amp;#8217;ve reflected a little on their PC branding partnership and the Linux-based SteamOS beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Given that this change has sparked a lot of interest, we thought it&amp;#8217;d make sense to address some of the points we&amp;#8217;ve seen people take away from it,&amp;#8221; Valve&amp;#8217;s Pierre-Loup Griffais &lt;a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/1696043806550421224/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.

This update is primarily a maintenance patch. Over the last few months lots of new systems and features have been introduced to the game and with those additions have come some small issues and strange new bugs. Hopefully this update will address those reported issues and get us back on solid ground. The dev team continues its work on the UGC conversion from Steam Workshop which is slated for 323. Always more to come, including something very special that could come with 323 as well, so stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved sentries slightly (contributed by Nin)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Prevent beeping noise while attacking and for 1.5 seconds afterwards&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Speed up barrel swivel when it has a target so you&amp;#39;re not getting shot at by a sentry facing the other way&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Add a delay after shooting at a target before starting to swivel and scan again&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Always show tracers from sentries so that players better know where they are getting shot at from&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sentries will prioritize players over other things, and will shoot at the closest players. Previously, they would prioritize anything that wasn&amp;#39;t a cyst.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Hydras do not block each other’s line of sight anymore (contributed by Katzenfleisch)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweaks / Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tweaked some marine pickup icons to appear more stylistically consistent.  (Thanks Sinakuwolf!)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Metabolize is no longer a switchable weapon.  This means you cannot accidentally switch to it any longer, and can only use it via the MovementModifier key.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Drifter Eggs can now be issued orders that will be carried out by the drifter when it hatches.  Before, drifters could only be issued rally-points.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;AI movers such as ARCs and movable alien structures like Crags would move on top of players, sometimes trapping them.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Tweaked the infestation shader slightly to better hide the hard edges of infestation circles.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Don’t show team resources for the Ready Room team at the scoreboard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that servers could get stuck in a infinite loop while filling teams up with bots.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that bots were not removed properly after they got kicked.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where ARCs would sometimes leave collision ghosts behind in PredictWorld.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that the &amp;quot;They Came From Behind!&amp;quot; achievement was granted in some incorrect circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that dying in an Exosuit would cause players to lose their unused grenades.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed issue where some commander buttons would not work if multiple entities were selected, despite the button being visible.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed issue where sometimes the lines connecting queued orders in the commander interface would be connected in the wrong order.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed issue where a marine&amp;#39;s welder and mines could be &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot; from them at the map origin if that player was inside an exosuit.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the build tool would be stuck building if the player picked up a welder while they were building a structure.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where players could be stuck attacking during a concede sequence.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the wrong tech point would be visible during a concede sequence.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where MACs could not be told to repair destroyed power nodes.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where MACs would sometimes disregard their orders to move to some previous location.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where sometimes clicking the &amp;quot;refresh&amp;quot; button in the server browser would cause the game to crash.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where deploying an ARC would prevent all future corrosion damage to the ARC, including after un-deploying the ARC.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a script error occuring if an Onos died while using stampede.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that gorges couldn’t recycle the second tunnel entrance they placed (contributed to Katzenfleisch)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a script error that occured if a marine had no active weapon (contributed to Katzenfleisch)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed various text positioning/visibility bugs of the GUIChat (contributed by Person8880)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Fixed that the marine commander action notifications below the minimap often did not  display the correct location name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed the reflections in ns2_veil.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editor    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exposed antialiasing and ambient occlusion settings for the map Editor.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;li&gt;Changed some popup messages to be console messages instead.&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Added debug utility methods to simplify dealing with upvalues (locals inside method/file scope) (contributed by Las)    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please read core/lua/DebugUtility.md for more details!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><author>WasabiOne</author><guid>2394101748799073153</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2018 16:46:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Factorio updates with heavy artillery and optimizations</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2383968628754439903</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for Factorio&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horrifically compelling sci-fi construction sandbox &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/factorio/"&gt;Factorio&lt;/a&gt; received &lt;a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/016-stable"&gt;another major update&lt;/a&gt;  over the holidays, bringing much-needed performance improvements to the game along with adding a whole new subset of heavyweight military technologies. This update also marks the start of the final stretch of development, with Wube Software announcing that &lt;a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/016-price-change"&gt;the price of the game will be increasing to $30&lt;/a&gt; later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literature&amp;#x2019;s had a pretty good run, much of it without any fancy graphics and animations and particle effects to bolster the words. Games love text too. Text is cheap. You can paint a picture of galactic chaos or epic history in about the same time it takes to type &amp;#x2018;and then something cool happened&amp;#x2019;, without having to spend the next week designing armour and creating 3D characters to act it out. Yet despite centuries of practice, most games still haven&amp;#x2019;t worked out how to present all this (which let&amp;#x2019;s face it, is often there more for the writers&amp;#x2019; satisfaction than our actual enjoyment) in a punchy, satisfying way. What works? What doesn&amp;#x2019;t? Let&amp;#x2019;s take a quick look at some of the ways games have handled books, letters, codexes and more.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when you don&amp;#x2019;t affect a world that much, it&amp;#x2019;s nice when it pretends. News stories are one of the best and cheapest ways to both highlight your achievements, and reframe them in interesting ways, from acts of heroism to outright terrorism. Human Revolution wrapped them in one of the sleekest packages for this&amp;#x2014;the Picus Daily Standard. At once a chance to see what was taking place out of your sphere, and see the effect of your adventures on the world. While even a few years later, the futuristic look feels distinctly retro compared to iPad news apps, to say nothing of whatever direct-brain interfaces we&amp;#x2019;ll likely have by the time of Deus Ex&amp;#x2019;s dark not-too-distant-future, Picus keeps it pretty, keeps it punchy, and above all, keeps it brief.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but when it comes to eBooks, things aren&amp;#x2019;t so smooth. Look at this. Even the original Kindle would wince at these datapad layouts, complete with non-slidable panels, slow refresh rate, poor quality fonts and typography, and non-consistent use of glows. Sure, it&amp;#x2019;s readable, but it&amp;#x2019;s hard to imagine anyone wanting to, even before factoring in that in the wasteful future of Deus Ex you apparently need a new device for every Wikipedia entry. The crappy quality of this design only stands out more amongst Mankind Divided&amp;#x2019;s otherwise superbly rendered future, where everything you encounter seems to have emerged fully formed from the brain of a maverick product genius. This, meanwhile, feels like a first attempt at customising Twine.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the not-too-distant future, who needs books? We&amp;#x2019;ll have computers! Specifically, ghastly green teletype machines that would be tolerable for simple acts like opening doors, but could be much more of a nightmare if the cast of Five Nights At Freddy&amp;#x2019;s occasionally popped up for a jump-scare. The horrible font. The clackering of the text. The endless pages that try their best &amp;#xA0;to tell stories of post-apocalyptic horror, despite being locked in an interface that would make even a hardened wasteland explorer decide that whatever happened probably doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter that much. Even accounting for the 50s vibe of the rest of the game, these are hideous technological throwbacks that knife their own storytelling in the back. The closest they come to being appropriate to the setting is that in using them, the living definitely envy the dead.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Skyrim / Ultima&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x2019;s an RPG shelf without a few strangely short books that probably don&amp;#x2019;t need hundreds of pages and a stiff leather jacket? While RPGs have always been wise enough to realise that most players will accept this deviation from reality, it&amp;#x2019;s still interesting to look at the differences between these two great franchises. Skyrim for instance clearly assumes that all of Tamriel&amp;#x2019;s readers are half-blind&amp;#x2014;or possibly playing on a television screen&amp;#x2014;leading to very slow-paced tales on glorified flashcards. Ultima meanwhile wanted you to squint. But at least Ultima had the advantage that unless a book was specifically screaming &amp;#x2018;crucial plot element&amp;#x2019;, it was most likely to be flavour, sparing you tediously flicking through shelves in the hope of finding a boost to one of your skills. At least both franchises keep their tongues firmly in their cheeks, whether it&amp;#x2019;s The Elder Scrolls&amp;#x2019; obsession with the Lusty Argonian Mage, or Ultima&amp;#x2019;s fine line of joke books, occasional explosive booby-trap pranks, and the revelation that wise Lord British, founder of Britannia&amp;#x2019;s favourite story is &amp;#x201C;Hubert the Lion&amp;#x201D;. Can&amp;#x2019;t sleep without it, apparently...&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A controversial one here, perhaps, but Mass Effect is one of the games where the built-in Codex arguably makes the world less enjoyable. The game does a fantastic job of introducing everything that&amp;#x2019;s actually important without relying on it as a crutch, with the dry writing and endless unlockable pages of SF guff coming across as homework rather than a gripping read. Do we really need to know, for example, the origins of every last whiffle-bolt supplier on the Citadel? No. It&amp;#x2019;s just not that important. Save it for the design bible and tie-in books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a few interesting flourishes, including Codex entries based on what the universe thinks rather than necessarily the actual truth, the Hitch-Hiker&amp;#x2019;s Guide To The Galaxy it is not. And ironically, it shows the difference itself, in the form of Mass Effect 2&amp;#x2019;s fantastic Shadow Broker DLC and the unlockable files within, which actually do give you a chance to peer at your party&amp;#x2019;s dirty little secrets. Jack&amp;#x2019;s secret love of poetry. Miranda&amp;#x2019;s online dating life. Tali&amp;#x2019;s repeated installation of a suit tool called &amp;#x2018;Nerve Stim Pro&amp;#x2019;. Oh, the blackmail opportunities...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishonored is a great example of how just a little thing can really annoy. Its text isn&amp;#x2019;t difficult to read, the font is pretty well chosen, if not exactly conveying the sense of a written document in the same way as many other games with this level of texture and detail, but does it really have to sway back and forth while you&amp;#x2019;re reading? There&amp;#x2019;s a time for ambient animation to breathe life into a scene, and a time to make the player feel slightly sea-sick. No. Scratch that. True for the first, not so much for the second. Swish&amp;#x2026; swish&amp;#x2026; it&amp;#x2019;s an effect applied to all the menus and other data screens and really contributes to making reading the lore an unpleasant experience. A shame, because that lore is actually interesting. Dunwall and Karnaca are two of gaming&amp;#x2019;s best cities, and their depth and backstory is fascinating. If you can stand to actually read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Longest Journey and Life Is Strange&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;m bundling these together because they do the same basic concept&amp;#x2014;the primary text in the game is our main character&amp;#x2019;s diary. This serves several purposes, including offering a potted version of the story if you dip away for a while and forget things, but most importantly giving us a direct look inside their head. It&amp;#x2019;s a technique that only works if you actually like the main character, but fortunately that&amp;#x2019;s not a problem for either series and its charismatic leading ladies. In particular, it&amp;#x2019;s a way of bridging the gap between our perception of the game, as an untouchable god-figure, and theirs, as someone for whom all these moral decisions are actual life-changing events. Simply seeing the game from that perspective is enough to make everything carry that much more weight, and it doesn&amp;#x2019;t hurt that they&amp;#x2019;re fun reads too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What separates The Witcher from most in-game codexes is its sense of character, with everything being described from the perspective of in-game poet, lover and occasional sidekick Dandelion. The nature of the game also rewarded taking the time to dip into the Codex, given that for a travelling monster-slayer, knowledge is power, and never took away from the fact that while us as players might not know our drowners from our necrophages, Geralt himself was always able to be a reliable source of information and provide the condensed version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Realms of the Haunting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#x2019;s a retro classic, sadly not helped by the low-resolutions of the mid-90s. Nothing damages the mood of an otherwise well-made document like peering at it through a letter-box and finding it more poorly compressed than an old JPEG from a lost Geocities page. It&amp;#x2019;s not quite as bad blown up to full screen though, and even with its technical problems, it demonstrated how to write documents that actually fit the world and contributed to the lore without feeling like extracts from the design bible. Most took the form of letters between the characters, their identities not always immediately obvious, and turning the relatively simple battle between good and evil at the heart of the story into an epic tale of Faustian deals, ancient cults, doomed love, and a deep mythology stretching between multiple worlds. The visual look certainly didn&amp;#x2019;t hurt, with everything presented as aged pages, hand-drawn maps and messily scrawled journals. And if you didn&amp;#x2019;t like them, you got to burn several of them as part of a puzzle. Splendid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Neverhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you really, really want to make sure nobody misses your game&amp;#x2019;s lore, there&amp;#x2019;s always the Hall of Records&amp;#x2014;aka The Place Where Basically All The Game&amp;#x2019;s Backstory Is, as carved onto the walls of a corridor that takes about five minutes to trudge through even if you ignore all of the words. Oh, and when you get to the other end? You have to walk back, obviously. You know it&amp;#x2019;s good stuff when even a game&amp;#x2019;s own wiki states, and we quote, &amp;#x201C;it is suggested by most not to read all of it.&amp;#x201D; Truly great literature. Who could ask for anything less?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, these are just a few cases. Which games have convinced you to pause saving the world to flick through a good book, and when has that background just been so much blah? It&amp;#x2019;s fun to get lost in backstory, just as long as the writers aren&amp;#x2019;t too obsessed with their own lore.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2383968106583431139</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 09:31:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Telltale teases The Walking Dead's final season with a nostalgic Clementine callback</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2383968106574421318</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telltale said last year that the final season of its Walking Dead adventure series would be &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-wolf-among-us-season-2-and-telltales-walking-dead-finale-are-coming-next-year/"&gt;out in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and so it will be: The studio tweeted the first tease of the last season earlier today with an image that very deliberately hearkens back to the game&amp;apos;s first season.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s a haunting callback, with a grown-up Clementine filling the shoes of man-with-an-axe Lee Everett, who bravely fought to keep her alive through the first season. Season four will also see the &lt;a href="https://telltale.com/news/2017/11/prepare-for-the-end-with-the-walking-dead-collection-available-december-5th-/?_ga=2.84926745.1426935565.1522438072-1134174869.1522438072"&gt;return of Gary Whitta&lt;/a&gt;, the former PC Gamer EIC who for some reason left all this fame and fortune behind to go do &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/former-pc-gamer-editor-and-walking-dead-writer-is-writing-a-star-wars-film/"&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote the fourth episode of season one, and will serve as a story consultant for the final season.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telltale said that the first proper look at the final season will be reveal at 12:30 pm ET on April 6 at its PAX East panel, which will also be viewable &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/telltalegames"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2383968106574421318</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 21:27:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Where The Water Tastes Like Wine was a 'commercial disaster,' dev says in painful post</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2383968106574118560</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for Gone Home&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Where The Water Tastes Like Wine&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story adventure game &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-review/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where The Water Tastes Like Wine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; struggled critically and flopped commercially, lead developer Johnnemann Nordhagen said today in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@johnnemann/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-postmortem-211a1f9d791a" target="_blank"&gt;a post-mortem of the game&lt;/a&gt;, in which he argues that its difficulties don&amp;apos;t bode well for experimental indie games.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Commercially, it&amp;#x2019;s a disaster,&amp;quot; Nordhagen said. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#x2019;t discuss exact numbers, but in the first few weeks fewer people bought the game than I have Twitter followers, and I don&amp;#x2019;t have a lot of Twitter followers.&amp;quot; (At the time of writing, Nordhagen has 4,272 followers.)&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Nordhagen received support from publisher Good Shepherd to complete and market the game, Where The Water Tastes Like Wine has yet to break even. &amp;quot;So far, I have made $0 from the game,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;That may look like a high number, but consider that it took four years to make&amp;#x200A;&amp;#x2014;&amp;#x200A;that works out to approximately $0/year &amp;#x2026; And then once you factor in the ~$140,000 I spent paying my contractors and collaborators for the game, you begin to see that maybe it wasn&amp;#x2019;t, financially speaking, worth it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where The Water Tastes Like Wine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Joking aside&amp;#x200A;&amp;#x2014;&amp;#x200A;that&amp;#x2019;s dismal. And terrifying,&amp;quot; Nordhagen said. &amp;quot;At the end of the day it&amp;#x2019;s astounding that a game that got this much attention from the press, that won awards, that had an all-star cast of writers and performers, that had a bizarre celebrity guest appearance(!) failed this hard. It scares me.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I   m not sure that games like this one can continue to be made in the current market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Johnnemann Nordhagen&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Nordhagen, it&amp;apos;s evidence of a growing trend for indie games: quality, acclaim, and attention aren&amp;apos;t guarantees of success. &amp;quot;That last part should be worrying for anyone in the indie games industry,&amp;quot; Nordhagen said. &amp;quot;[Where The Water Tastes Like Wine] could have been a non-commercial game, but it would have had to be very different. It would be far less polished, it wouldn&amp;#x2019;t have had the collaborators that it did, I could not have paid people who couldn&amp;#x2019;t afford to work for revenue share or for the love of the game (thus, I fear, cutting out some of the most valuable voices that this game was a platform for). I could have developed it as a side project, but it took me four years as is. Basically, I&amp;#x2019;m not sure that games like this one can continue to be made in the current market.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nordhagen also discussed the development factors he believes contributed to Where The Water Tastes Like Wine&amp;apos;s uphill battle. For example, it received relatively little playtesting, especially close to launch, and it abruptly lost both of its main artists mid-development. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#x2019;t originally have the knowledge I needed to tackle many of the issues I encountered during development,&amp;quot; he said, adding that the game itself &amp;quot;was too much to take on as a solo dev, and especially too much to take on as a commercial product.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone Home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordhagen previously worked as lead programmer on Gone Home, which was well-received when it released in 2014. Encouraged by Gone Home&amp;apos;s success, Nordhagen was optimistic about Where The Water Tastes Like Wine. However, in 2018, he&amp;apos;s unsure if creating games like these is even feasible. &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In 2014, starting a similar project seemed like a good creative and financial risk,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Four years later, making any commercial game at all seems like a bad idea, and taking on the risk of an experimental, ambitious game like Where the Water Tastes Like Wine sounds terrifying.&amp;quot; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 I think was a very different time for smaller indie games&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Steve Gaynor&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writer and designer Steve Gaynor, who also worked on Gone Home, made a similar point about experimental games &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fullbrights-steve-gaynor-on-tacoma-and-the-changing-state-of-indie/" target="_blank"&gt;when we spoke to him&lt;/a&gt; following the release of Fullbright&amp;apos;s Tacoma, a delightful narrative-driven game whose sales paled in comparison to Gone Home&amp;apos;s at launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think there were a lot of things about Gone Home&amp;#x2019;s launch that were kind of &amp;apos;lightning in a bottle,&amp;apos;&amp;quot; Gaynor said. &amp;quot;2013 I think was a very different time for smaller indie games coming out that were kind of reaching into the triple-A fidelity space. Also I think that we were lucky to be responding to what I think was a real desire for more games that were less violent or more focused on story or whatever. And so yeah, Tacoma&amp;#x2019;s release I think has been a much more realistic version of what launching a game is usually like.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tacoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordhagen&amp;apos;s post-mortem focuses on the game&amp;apos;s development and reception, but he&amp;apos;s not the only member of the team to look back on Where The Water Tastes Like Wine. Lead editor &lt;a href="https://blog.lauramichet.com/2018/03/04/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-postmortem/" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Michet wrote a lengthy analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the herculean task of coordinating the game&amp;apos;s many writers, and several writers, like Emily Short, have explored &lt;a href="https://emshort.blog/2018/03/27/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-2/" target="_blank"&gt;how they wrote their individual characters&lt;/a&gt;. You can find more analyses in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@johnnemann/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-postmortem-211a1f9d791a" target="_blank"&gt;Nordhagen&amp;apos;s post.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2383968106574118560</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 19:35:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Friday Facts #236 - Building a rollup</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2383968106573226825</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Factorio&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As you are probably already aware, some of our team members are going to attend PAX East in Boston next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We figured we need some representative prints for our booth, but what to put there? We could have just made a big mega high resolution render of the player character or some other entity, but that would not tell the viewer much about what the game is about. So we thought it would be much better to &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; take a giant screenshot of a working factory, print it, and done! Now of course it’s much more complicated than that…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first obvious hurdle is that you need a savegame to take this screenshot of. So you go and try to take a bunch of random saves on your disk, you open them and find that it’s not so easy to just find a factory which would look nice. Such a factory needs to show enough of the various things to represent the game, can fit the logo somewhere, and must be large enough to fill about 275x185 tiles (3x2 meters at 150dpi taken at game zoom 2)&amp;#8230; one square in the following picture is a chunk (32x32 tiles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/911f9b99eb45adb9547461290f7a78dd502b452b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I just had a savegame which was easy to adapt to those requirements, but I would like to ask the question, how does one build such a factory in general? That’s what I have been trying to figure out for a long time now. As some of you may have already noticed, I enjoy constructing very organic factories, a part of which eventually turns into a crazy mess. A mess as crazy as Factorio itself, representing what your will brain look like after playing Factorio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/479c38365b0bc48047e11f46fea6f4375775652e.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be a good opportunity to be a bit more specific and see a few examples to put it into more context&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building for big screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;It’s the year 2015 and pretty much every factory I had built so far eventually arrived to the problem that in order to expand it, I would have to severely modify or destroy large portions of it. I hate to just throw away all the work that I did on my belt knots, so the outcome would usually be that I just stop playing that map and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example 1, codename: MessFort:&lt;/h2&gt;Once I made a factory that was my largest so far. It used Bobs productivity modules level 7 with a stupid amount of productivity bonus, possible to put into any recipe, and without decreasing the speed of the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This alone may sound ridiculous but what it did was allow me to focus on just having fun adding more and more things to the factory, while caring about throughput much less, especially in situations where I could just add better modules to existing factories, leaving more ingredients for other things, allowing me to build even more production lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course sooner or later the furnace area would just not be enough and expanding it on the spot would be a pain, so I just started a new dedicated factory just for smelting like many factories do. Trains brought the necessary things and later on I added another factory for circuits and the factory kept being happy. Eventually I dropped under 40 UPS and didn’t want to continue any more. It’s worth mentioning that there was no space science or infinite research back then, so there was little incentive to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discoveries&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixed belts (different item on each belt half) are a huge amount of fun to work with, and add more visual variety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automating as many different recipes as feasible is one step towards a nice looking base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/8e98b13728ff2e70c807a53a42cb23ee7762e874.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example 2, codename: SpaceScienceBase&lt;/h2&gt;In the second half of 2016, I started a new factory. Learning from the past discoveries, I wanted to embrace the concept of replacing production lines for intermediates with train stations which would import these items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Producing those intermediates however required a large rail system outside of the main belt cluster. This gave the factory a lot more expandability and I had spent more time on this map (160 hrs) than any before by a large margin. Like all nice things, the amount of effort directly influences how nice is the result going to be, as with the outer train network expanding, the main base also continued to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discoveries&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having rails inside of the factory adds a lot of depth by breaking the monotonous assembling machine + belt mess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pipes and oil-related entities are awesome to have in the base so that not everything is an assembling machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/c1cee79d6ac496ddab0a946a7d3e6d0e216213f5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Examples 3 and 4, Codenames: TrainMaze and MOAR&lt;/h2&gt;In the following several months I would try to start a few new maps with different factories and different concepts, but each time something just wasn’t going in the right direction and eventually I would recognize that it’s not &amp;quot;The One&amp;quot; and lose interest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/fd1064386fc155ec6cf188043fee80dd3dea01f3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to feel like it was only a matter of luck, and I only made the SpaceScienceBase look awesome by accident as I couldn’t deliberately achieve the same again. I kept thinking about what it is that makes it stand out, what are the differences from the other two, for example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disabling biters or minimizing military removes many recipes to automate, and easily leads to a less interesting factory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too many straight and rectangular patterns just look visually uninteresting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preparing all setups for beacon rows from the beginning forces a lot of straight predictable lines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horizontal production rows of machines generally look better than vertical columns, but having some vertical columns is good for variety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/cf5a59f8f4fbd869c70bb616afcfcad8d945bc71.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe a part of the problem was how I focused on efficiency by preparing for whole rows of beacons for everything (especially the vertical ones), or how I separated the oil and rail related entities from the core of the main factory. Everything just ended up being straight and boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example 5: GridLock&lt;/h2&gt;So eventually I started a new map with all of those things in mind. I made a rough plan for myself what I would like it to end up, and then tried to follow it. The rail system would be extremely expandable but use both single and dual headed trains for variety, the main factory would automate literally every single recipe in the game, and I would try to keep things as organic as possible. I could have tried harder to put more pipe and nuclear related entities in the middle of the factory&amp;#8230; perhaps next time I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you can see it grow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/UJPFUQhnXS8"&gt;https://youtu.be/UJPFUQhnXS8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was building, I saved over 300 iterative versions of the map. The timelapse is then created by taking a screenshot in each of those saves, and in post-production they are blended together so that it looks smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that we need a screenshot of these dimensions just shortly before the logo appears on the map. You can see not much had to change, except all the terrain under the whole screenshot area was manually reworked in the map editor. This gave me a bunch of ideas of what we need to do to make the map editor better - both for our use with scenarios and campaign, and for our players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in reading more about how the base works or downloading the savegame, you can proceed to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://imgur.com/a/FmoBY"&gt;imgur album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/6a85790698543f8ec117de70d6fea3d99367f9ce.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result is a trio of rollups totalling 3 meters in width and 2 meters in height. This whole thing has been quite an experience for me. Building a factory and doing my own fiddling is great, but building a factory, sitting down with Albert (our art director), thinking how to improve the general visual composition of it, making it fit the requirements etc. was just outright amazing. Just the part where I needed to put the logo and remove a bunch of train stations, cut many belts and reconnect them, was a very cool challenge. If I started again I would have probably done a few things differently, but something would probably be wrong if I didn’t feel like that. Overall I must say I am quite satisfied with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/b94606f3b23b56891fe37e87e5bcb88ea2b90af1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a friend of yours is trying to introduce you to this game, shows this screenshot to you and says: &amp;quot;Hey, this is the game I have been repeatedly telling you about lately&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.factorio.com/59207"&gt;What would be your response?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2383968106573226825</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 13:50:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Guacamelee! 2 Coming to Steam  Drinkbox 10th Anniversary Sale</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2383968106573195903</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Guacamelee!

We&amp;#39;re excited to announce that Guacamelee! 2 will be coming to Steam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;#39;re thinking of picking up the game, we&amp;#39;d love it if you could add us to your Steam Wishlist.

Dear all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Version 0.16 has become stable, and this means that there is one last step for us to reach the 0.17 which will probably become 1.0 version. Then Factorio will finally step out of the Early Access zone. This will take some months but the roadmap is clear for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We feel that now is a good time to adjust the price of the game. The price of the game has been growing steadily together with the game becoming bigger, more stable and polished. After careful consideration, we have decided to set the new price of the game to 30 USD (or your regional equivalent). This change will become effective as of 16th of April 2018. This is the final Factorio price update, unless something unforeseen happens, so it will also be the price for the game for 1.0 release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you probably know we have a strict no sale policy. The game will not go on sale on Steam or any other platform. This basically means that purchasing before the 16th of April 2018 is the only way to buy the game cheaper than the increased release price.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>Klonan</author><guid>2383968106573187651</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 13:35:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop Update - March 30, 2018</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2383968106572359536</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZ7ogfkR3hQ"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark of the Ninja: Remastered will freshen up &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/mark-of-the-ninja-review/" target="_blank"&gt;one of our all-time favorite stealth games&lt;/a&gt; later this year, developer Klei Entertainment announced.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standout even among Klei Entertainment&amp;apos;s sterling repertoire, Mark of the Ninja originally released in 2012, and while its cartoony art has aged well, Klei reckons it could do with a tune-up. So for the remaster, they&amp;apos;re targeting &amp;quot;fully redone 4K visuals for both gameplay and cutscenes along with enhanced audio and new particle effects.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaster will also come with the content from Mark of the Ninja&amp;apos;s Special Edition DLC. That includes a new level, two new items, a suite of non-lethal takedowns, and a heaping helping of developer commentary.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klei hasn&amp;apos;t shared much else on the remaster, but in a follow-up &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klei/status/978701598259011584" target="_blank"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the studio did note they&amp;apos;re &amp;quot;working out reward paths for existing players depending on if they own the regular games vs also owning the special edition.&amp;quot; So it&amp;apos;s possible existing Mark of the Ninja owners will receive some sort of discount or in-game compensation.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/28/mark-of-the-ninja-remastered-pc-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;RockPaperShotgun&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2383968106570677430</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:53:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Tinker Time beta updated!</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2365953485471855062</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Awesomenauts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/d9fd955a7a5293eaf0a400777230c05ff0e821a8.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey everyone, we just released an update for the Awesomenauts 4.6: Tinker Time beta! Catch the full patch notes for this Beta compared to the current live version below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the important changes in this Beta compared to the previous Beta is that Commander Rocket no longer resets the charges on his Salvo when using Rocket Launch, some additional tweaks to Derpl and Sentry, and further changes to Professor M. Yoolip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please share your feedback &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=19"&gt;on our forums&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/cf19c3b5917941055204147d2b4745161cdff74c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander Rocket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently too safe and very hard to catch, Rocket needs to be easier to punish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket Launch, no longer knocks back enemies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Base Health, reduced from 1150 to 1100&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laser Trap is too unreliable, doing either too much damage or none at all. These changes should make its effect more reliable while also making placement a little bit more skillful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, time between damage ticks increased from 0.2 to 0.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, damage per tick increased from 60 to 90.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, rotation speed increased by 50%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, laser length reduced by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, no longer has deployment time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laser Trap, duration reduced from 4 to 3 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some upgrade adjustments based on the above changes. These are intended to keep Rocket brawling closer to his Laser Trap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profanity filters, now increases trap duration by 2 seconds for 160 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Borgo Cigar cutter, CMDR Rocket gets a shield which reduces 30% of the incoming damage as long as he is nearby a deployed laser trap.
&lt;em&gt;This upgrade is still too strong and mandatory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Box of Cirean cigars, damage per particle per stage reduced from 20 to 16.
&lt;em&gt;His Rocket Launch no longer deals damage to turrets, but his turret push is still too intense. Adjusting the numbers and making them more consistent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charged Salvo, damage modifier against droids increased from 75% to 80%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charged Salvo, damage modifier against turrets reduced from 100% to 80%.
&lt;em&gt;This upgrade was a holdover from a time where Rocket’s Laser Trap had a lot more uptime. The intention for this replacement is to enable Rocket to be a bit better at brawling and allowing him to stay a bit closer to the fight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Head in Jar, now adds 16% damage to Charged Salvo when firing a single rocket, two stages for 175 solar each.
&lt;em&gt;Part of his safety comes from his relatively high ranged base attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charged Salvo, range reduced by 20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medal Booster Pack, range increase reduced from 25% to 20%.
&lt;em&gt;Combining Rocket Launch and a full Charged Salvo at melee range provides too much damage, too easily. At the same time we want to stimulate him to get more into the thick of the fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket Launch, now deals between 150 and 350 damage, depending on how long the rocket has been flying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mother of Bombs, after using Rocket Launch without hitting an enemy, your next Charged Salvo shot will deal 100 more damage for 170 solar.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/823d399cc943558129d3bb1f405c248306662d21.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Derpl&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Considered too strong specifically on Ribbit and Starstorm, these tweaks attempt to adjust him without affecting his general performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siege mode, Derpl is no longer immune to CC during the transformation out of siege mode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combustion lava lamp, size increase reduced from 22% to 18%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Falling acceleration reduced by 20%.
&lt;em&gt;Traps can be very oppressive, maxing out at full 2.4 seconds of no gameplay for the receiving party. Their long lifetime also stimulates camping gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, snare duration reduced from 1.6 to 1.2 seconds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, now also slows for 25% for 2.4 seconds. (extenting 1.2 seconds beyond the snare)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, base lifetime reduced from 11 to 9 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Empowered Grid, snare increase per stage reduced from 0.4 to 0.3 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead casing, the silence now has a fixed duration of 2.4 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap, now charges in the middle of Derpl instead of having an arming time when placed.
&lt;em&gt;Some base attack adjustments to better balance the row and take the above changes into account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat Cat, cooldown increased from 4 to 5 seconds, price increased from 185 to 195.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kitty Catsuit, price decreased from 175 to 150 solar per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAT package, price decreased from 175 to 150 solar per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bat Catsuit, now deals 100% increased damage against Nauts who are snared or slowed, no longer works with Fat Cat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long Cat, now works with Fat Cat.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/306d6f4cd9cfb2e4744d49e424863f0562d72426.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dizzy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dizzy is currently a bit too strong. But she&amp;#39;s also very finicky, and has a lot of weak upgrades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi Dash, time between dashes increased from 0.3 to 0.4 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi Dash, damage per dash increased from 150 to 160.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walkbot Pro, speed up dash reload time by 30% when you are near to enemies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explosive Clone, cooldown increased from 6 to 7 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backstage pass, increase the range of your Multi Dash by 25% when you have the maximum amount of dashes charged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matching Glittery Dungarees, now reduces the cooldown for the next Explosive Clone by 3 seconds when it hits an enemy Awesomenaut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Purple Prince&amp;quot; lipstick, now also slows enemies when they leave the bubble as well as when they are hit by the explosion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bubble shot, size increased by 50%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graffiti artist, price increased from 165 to 190.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tipi teal, merged to one stage of 30% range and speed increase for 140 solar.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/89e6d6a97346b9e10bb82ea3b76823a8a1089bdc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ix&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ix generally still brings too much to the table overall, great displace move, solid heals, invincibility frames, excellent mobility and strong brawling. In order to nudge him more towards his role his brawling should be reduced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refract, cooldown increased from 9 to 10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiate, damage per Scatter reduced from 15 to 12.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mammoth hair scarf, ally speed bonus increased from 12% to 15% per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tree hugger, ally damage boost increased from 12% to 15% per stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personality Crystal, range increase reduced from 35% to 30%.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/92056c0875f58423dbc8774bae1acad1ef54924d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lonestar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ribbit snail slime, fixed that the healthpack would time out if it fell for too long.
&lt;em&gt;Since these aren’t that much better than regular boots, they also don’t have to cost much more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket boots, solar price reduced from 160 to 140.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Base speed, increased by 4%.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/32af7797f04668c4503d32c67c12e724841d75e0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Max Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This item has its use, but it&amp;#39;s too weak and expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From pond to podium, merged into one stage which adds 30% range and speed for 200 solar.
&lt;em&gt;The homing upgrade looks cool, but doesn&amp;#39;t do much. Here is a replacement proposal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFO spotted, now gives +50% speed during Scene Illumination for 160 solar.
&lt;em&gt;This upgrade is just a bit too expensive, especially given the next change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sadak mysteries, price reduced from 195 to 175 solar.
&lt;em&gt;Removing the stacking will reduce the need to combo with Sadak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brutalities of the Kraken, damage increased from 120 to 135 per stage, no longer stacks with Sadak mysteries.
&lt;em&gt;This item is just a bit too expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rob Bourgogne, price reduced from 180 to 160 per stage.
&lt;em&gt;This item was overnerfed shortly after launch, because the skill was too strong to begin with at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hairy King, size increase increased from 10% to 15%, price increased from 175 to 200 solar.
&lt;em&gt;Some overpriced items.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don Steward, price per stage reduced from 175 to 140 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pete Jennirks, price reduced from 240 to 200 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incriminating dirt, price reduced from 180 to 150 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flying camera, price reduced from 210 to 150 solar.
&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, this one&amp;#39;s underpriced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hidden microphone, price increased from 170 to 200 solar.
&lt;em&gt;This item is the strongest on the row, it doesn&amp;#39;t need to stack further.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Galactic police scanner, no longer stacks with incriminating dirt, price increased from 180 to 220 solar.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/ed41d63c6b924f52411cec848bbdf99405c2cae4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nibbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firebreath, fixed that after being Cocooned by Genji during Firebreath she wouldn&amp;#39;t resume after the Cocoon wears off.
&lt;em&gt;Some price adjustments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skull dunduns, price reduced from 200 to 180.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eye of Coba, price reduced from from 215 to 190.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dragon Speaker Idol, now has two stages of +10% attack speed each, at 150 solar per stage.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/6531b00b86ae6b0bdbc084cc9daad93c01a40cfd.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Professor Milton Yoolip&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Some adjustments to improve the item balance for the gaze row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beard Trimming Fork, price reduced from 165 to 130 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syrup Pouring Robot, maximum lifesteal increased from 120 to 150 per stage.
&lt;em&gt;Some changes to make Dinos more reliable at base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summon Robo Dinos, now jump at enemies at base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summon Robo Dinos, damage per bite reduced from 80 to 75.
&lt;em&gt;Now this upgrade has become useless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holo Pet Food, now reduces the damage dealt by Nauts who have been bitten by 15% for 1.5 seconds.

&lt;strong&gt;Qi’Tara&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made Qi&amp;#39;Taras seven star strike visual only in front of Qi&amp;#39;Tara to represent the area where damage was being applied better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that she couldn’t use Chakram Shift to teleport while using Seven Star Strike when the Salty Seal upgrade was bought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made Qi&amp;#39;Taras seven star strike visual only in front of Qi&amp;#39;Tara to represent the area where damage was being applied better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that the Lily of the Isle projectiles would spawn at her feet during Seven Star Strike.
&lt;em&gt;Qi’Tara deals too much damage during Seven Star Strike, and too little outside of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven star strike, attack speed increase reduced from 40% to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poisonous blade, direct damage increased from 45 to 50.
&lt;em&gt;Her relationship with speed feels disjointed, where attacking slows her down but Seven Star Strike speed her up etc. These changes also tie in with the issue above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poisonous Blade, removed movement penalty when attacking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven Star Strike, removed speed bonus during the ability.
&lt;em&gt;With the changes above, this upgrade has now become useless. This change will make Qi’Tara’s damage output more reliable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chilasi Chakram, now speeds up the damage over time of Poisonous blade by 20% for 160 solar.
&lt;em&gt;Since the bug was fixed where this upgrade doubled your damage, this upgrade has become too weak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lily of the Isle, projectile speed and range increased by 30%.
&lt;em&gt;Salty Seal makes Qi’Tara almost unstoppable, this change should make counterplay possible again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salty Seal, now cleanses all slows, snares and chains at the start of Seven Star Strike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salty Seal, now activates a shield that blocks 100 damage and provides immunity against slows, stuns, snares, chains, gravity and time warps as long as it’s active.
&lt;em&gt;Other tweaks and adjustments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven star strike, now also gives a 10% lifesteal effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baby plumbin oil, additional lifesteal reduced from 30% to 15% for 175 solar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rakki Comb, merged to one stage which adds 200% damage vs. droids for 155 solar.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/c3e6b9ea5315191e6b97f4d8f5951b5c8162cf62.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Raelynn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iron Rifle, fixed that the shield didn’t last long enough to protect the entire charge duration.
&lt;em&gt;This weak upgrade has some heavy competition on the row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monkey hand, range increase increased from 25% to 40%.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/7a582ca443e88ea8625584a74d664a6f6567dd19.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rocco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Birdseed donuts, cooldown reduction when hit increased from 2 to 4 seconds, duration increase increased from 1 to 2 seconds.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/01394ae6ab660d8f2b8eecb87756a5579245d737.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scoop&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;His base attack is a bit too weak in general&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sword Strike, Slash damage increased from 100 to 105, Cleave lifesteal increased from 20% to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Banner of the Triple Scoop, price per stage reduced from 130 to 100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Halberd of Justice, bonus damage reduced from 25% to 22%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Titanium Coneshield, price increased from 130 to 150 solar per stage.
&lt;em&gt;Other tweaks and adjustments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brutally Whipped Cream, price reduced from 200 to 180 per stage.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/713fb830953afd54abcf5557ac9a64e88e95c9a4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sentry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that Sentry’s Beacon no longer emitted a phone interference sound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed that Starstorm statue didn&amp;#39;t affect Bug detector.
&lt;em&gt;Reducing his efficiency of laying down mines in choke-points which has little to no counter-play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mines, damage while stationary reduced from 80 to 70.
&lt;em&gt;With this change in mind, a counter-buff to help him land reliable damage output in close ranged scenarios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mines, damage on direct hit increased from 80 to 90.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Projectile speed of mines increased by 15%.
&lt;em&gt;Camouflage tent is currently emphasizing passive play. This change will reward aggressive use of his AA by increasing his chase potency and reliability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camouflage tent, now increases projectile speed and range by 15%, one stage for 175 solar.
&lt;em&gt;Drive-over skulls is also providing a lot of easy chip damage and can be replaced with a more active timing based auto-attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive-over skulls, now deals +75% direct damage when not firing for 1.5s.
&lt;em&gt;Currently Black Hole Sun feels inconsistent and very hard to avoid, and if avoided it lingers for a whole 1.5s. This is an attempt at making BHS a more reliable ability and feel more fair on both ends. Starting with rewarding precision and aim on Sentry&amp;#39;s end while allowing enemies to dodge the skill easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, projectile distance increased by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, projectile speed increased by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, size of black hole reduced by 15%.
&lt;em&gt;The next set of changes are both aimed at compensating for the size reduction but also to reduce the duration of BHS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, minimum gravity increased by 8%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, maximum gravity increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, duration of black hole reduced from 1.5s to 1.2s.
&lt;em&gt;With these changes aside, his shield charging up also adds up a lot of time where he&amp;#39;s difficult to punish. Reducing his shield duration both allows him for using his black hole quicker, while also being vulnerable faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shield duration reduced from 2s to 1.5s.
&lt;em&gt;With less up-time of his shields, his base shield scaling could be increased to fulfill his tanky role. This allows him to tank a little extra in fights and reward aggressive play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Hole Sun, Base shield increased from 20% to 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microfilm, shielding reduced from 10% to 8%, price reduced to 140 solar per stage.
&lt;em&gt;Some Sentry&amp;#39;s just leave their beacon sitting somewhere in order to reveal or permanently put pressure on an area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teleport Beacon, times out after 45 seconds.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/533ccae8a301b7a6bcef4fbf5a4f4d898dd7768d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Skree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made separate spawnpoints for Sawblade and Spare blade, and moved them apart a little.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sawblade, now deals direct damage instead of damage over time.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/033fc68a9b5c59a6506c8ae4255a147a60ccc750.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Smiles&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Smiles has been overnerfed in the last few updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Base health, increased from 1550 to 1650.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trapper’s hook, cooldown reduced from 10 to 8 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bush fire, range increased by 25%.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/36aa2148c877b5ffaaec29de1e2eb29778af0b34.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swiggins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poolboy, price reduced from 240 to 210 solar.

&lt;img style="display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;" src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3948077/04d99daf1b3c440ab3cc1dcc537d922ea50d6a19.jpg"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yuri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uranium spikes, price increased from 125 to 150 per stage.&lt;/li&gt;</description><author>Mitaki</author><guid>2365953485471855062</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 15:37:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Get nostalgic and play with the classic gloves in Q.U.B.E. 2!</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2365953485471675897</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swell side-scrolling stealth game &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/mark-of-the-ninja/"&gt;Mark Of The Ninja&lt;/a&gt; is being snazzed up for the release of a &amp;#8216;Remastered&amp;#8217; edition. The game is largely hidden in the shadows for now, but developers Klei Entertainment say it &amp;#8220;will feature fully redone 4K visuals for both gameplay and cutscenes along with enhanced audio and new particle effects&amp;#8221;. Having announced Mark Of The Ninja: Remastered for Nintendo Switch last week, Klei last night confirmed that yup, it is coming to PC too. Here, see this cinematic trailer. &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/28/mark-of-the-ninja-remastered-pc-confirmed/#more-530483" class="more-link"&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I   d wager most folk around these parts devoured &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/left-4-dead/"&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/a&gt; back in the day, just as I did. Valve   s    28 Days Later with your friends    infected my life for a good year, and a bigger, better sequel one year later only strengthened the disease. But as Valve haven   t really been in the business of making games for a good few years &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-10-hooray-valve-is-going-to-start-shipping-games-again"&gt;hopefully, that   s about to change&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; and while it felt like Left 4 Dead was going to change the world back in (oh no) 2008, for a long time nothing filled the rotten hole where my heart used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until Fatshark   s rowdy rat-smash, &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/warhammer-vermintide-2/"&gt;Vermintide&lt;/a&gt;. The four vs the world setup and the UI were highly reminiscent of Left 4 Dead, and what are Gutter Runners and Pack Masters if not reskinned Hunters and Smokers? But there was much more to that game than swapping out zombies for skaven. With both series  now/still on their second games, let   s look at how Vermintide ran with the legacy of Left 4 Dead, while managing to forge its own identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, three games design students at Newport University were thrown together and given six weeks to create their final project. But none of them knew how to code. &amp;quot;We learnt everything from scratch,&amp;quot; says Dan Da Rocha, one of the trio. &amp;quot;It was always going to be a student project&amp;#x2014;a portfolio piece to go and get a job at a large studio.&amp;quot; Soon it was something much bigger, and two years later the group released the game on Steam, where it would go on to reach more than 200,000 players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they created in those six weeks was an early version of &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/239430/QUBE_Directors_Cut/" target="_blank"&gt;Q.U.B.E.&lt;/a&gt;, a first-person puzzle game about manipulating blocks in a 3D environment. They showed it off at their graduation, and their lecturers and the assortment of gathered developers were impressed. Mike Bithell, creator of &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/Thomas_Was_Alone/" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Was Alone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/365770/Volume/" target="_blank"&gt;Volume&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the faces among the crowd. &amp;quot;He told us we should go indie, and we were like, &amp;apos;Indie, what&amp;apos;s that?&amp;apos;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;apos;d soon find out. After a couple of rounds of funding, and lots of iteration, the trio had a fully-formed game ready to go. It was smart puzzler with lots of potential, but as &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/qube-review/" target="_blank"&gt;PC Gamer&amp;apos;s review&lt;/a&gt; said at the time, it had too few ideas to be a classic. Its plain white walls felt sterile, devoid of personality&amp;#x2014;a world away from Portal, which it was inevitably compared to.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month the group&amp;#x2014;now called Toxic Games&amp;#x2014;released a sequel that improves on the original in nearly every way. It&amp;apos;s one of the most accomplished puzzlers this year, and a very pretty game too. So how did the team go from humble student project to tight, polished puzzler? I spoke to Da Rocha, now the developer&amp;#x2019;s managing director, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxic Games made the original Q.U.B.E. without an art team, and opted to &amp;quot;play to its strengths&amp;quot; with minimalist visuals that would let the puzzles shine. In Q.U.B.E. 2, they&amp;apos;ve gone all out. The game is split into district areas&amp;#x2014;one an overgrown forest where you jump over the gnarly roots of thick trees, the next built from cavernous laboratory chambers with rotating walls. It&amp;apos;s all full of color and shiny surfaces that amplify the stylish lighting.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art team initially pictured the player being stranded in the desert, but were inspired to add more varied environments by The Crystal Maze, a cult-classic British game show in which teams travel through themed sectors completing puzzles and obstacle courses. &amp;quot;The same white, sterile environment can get a bit tiring on your eyes, a bit intense,&amp;quot; Da Rocha says. &amp;quot;So we wanted to make it much more colorful and go for some different themes: a jungle theme, a sand theme.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We brought in an art director and took a chance on a graduate environment artist, and he knocked it out of the park with the assets. Our producer and writer Ben Hill had a clear vision of what the environment would look like, so they all liaised together to create this beautiful world.&amp;quot; The key was attention to detail. Art director Harry Corr knew the game&amp;#x2019;s environment so well by the end that at one point in development he spotted a single light shaft out of place.&amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching the magnet's polarity lets you surf that block over the airflow of a fan, which nudges your trajectory just enough for you to make it onto a high ledge and exit the level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s not just a better-looking game&amp;#x2014;it&amp;apos;s more complex, and its puzzles are more satisfying to solve. In the original you could only place a block of a certain color on a predefined surface, marked by the corresponding color. In Q.U.B.E. 2, you can place any block in any available spot, which requires a little more thought. The number of cubes goes down from five to three&amp;#x2014;Da Rocha says that was &amp;quot;cutting the fat&amp;quot;&amp;#x2014;but to make up for the change it introduces magnets, oil slicks, fans that make you float, and doors that have to be burned to open.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individually, these mechanics are hardly ground-breaking, but Q.U.B.E. 2 does an excellent job making you feel like you&amp;apos;re mastering its toolset by gradually ramping up the complexity. &amp;quot;We wanted to keep it very simple and build complexity into the puzzles themselves. We wanted to make it easier to understand,&amp;quot; Da Rocha says. The team wanted each mechanic, introduced one-by-one as you progress, to feel like a &amp;quot;new toy to play with.&amp;quot; That means you&amp;apos;re given three or four easy puzzles when you first encounter each one, and then pushed onto trickier tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about them is how they interact, and how the game creates challenges by layering them on top of each other. When you first come across the magnets, for example, you&amp;apos;ll simply be bouncing cubes into their range, rotating them so they face a door, and then switching them to &amp;apos;repel&amp;apos;, which makes them fire the block out and smash the door down.&amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon you&amp;apos;re using them in conjunction with previously introduced mechanics. In one memorable puzzle you use the attract/repel switches to fling a block across the map and then, eventually, you end up standing on top of that block while a magnet holds it in place. Switching the magnet&amp;apos;s polarity lets you surf that block over the airflow of a fan, which nudges your trajectory just enough for you to make it onto a high ledge and exit the level. Sticking that landing made me grin for a good few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end you&amp;apos;re playing with four or five different systems at a time. One of the final puzzles requires you to continuously rotate a wall using the magnet that&amp;apos;s sticking to it to catch a block that you&amp;apos;ve bounced from on high. Meanwhile, you&amp;apos;re coating a different block in oil so that you can skid it across the level, timing a switch for a flamethrower to set that block on fire at just the right moment so that you can then nudge it into a flammable door. It all gets pretty complex, and some of the later puzzles might require a full half hour of head-scratching before you crack them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of what makes Q.U.B.E. 2 a better game is Toxic Games&amp;apos; growth behind the scenes. The initial team of three is now eight-strong, and unfilled positions were taken up by contractors, including a producer to keep everything on schedule. That means that Da Rocha and the core team could spend more time on the game itself. &amp;quot;In Q.U.B.E. 1 it was us wearing many hats, which is probably good for us in the long-term, but in the short-term it&amp;apos;s a killer. If you&amp;#x2019;re doing the design of the game then the business development will suffer, so with this we&amp;apos;ve got key people involved in every aspect. That&amp;apos;s freed up time to work on the development and the fun stuff.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, we're looking at other stuff. We've done some other prototypes, and we're taking a little mental break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dan Da Rocha&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team all worked remotely, but the end result is coherent. Its one weakness is the story, which is muddled, takes itself too seriously, and involves a few too many logical leaps. The basic premise is that you&amp;apos;re archaeologist Amelia Cross, and you wake up in an alien landscape with no idea how you got there. It&amp;apos;s set up to be a personal tale about her family, which you find out about through inner monologue, but then goes off-track and ends up being about the relationship between humans and a strange race of machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;apos;re given zero reason to care about these machines other than the fact that they (mild spoiler alert) are in control of the landscape that you&amp;apos;re puzzling through. The game doesn&amp;apos;t devote enough time to dialogue to explain this properly, and as a result tries to pack too much into each encounter with another character, which just left me confused.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does provide breaks in pace, and some of the dialogue happens when you&amp;apos;re confronted with the game&amp;apos;s most dramatic vistas so you can admire the view while you listen in. It&amp;apos;s unobtrusive enough that it never stopped me from enjoying Q.U.B.E. 2&amp;apos;s puzzles, which is where the meat of the game lies, just like in the first game&amp;#x2014;which barely had a story at all until they added one in a Director&amp;apos;s Cut edition.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the overall improved sequel hits its mark with players as well as the original remains to be seen, but regardless, it might well be the last Q.U.B.E. game the studio makes. When I ask Da Rocha whether he&amp;apos;s working on a third, he chuckles. &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;ve joked about it. At the moment, we&amp;apos;re looking at other stuff. We&amp;apos;ve done some other prototypes, and we&amp;apos;re taking a little mental break.&amp;quot; He mentions that some of the team, during development of Q.U.B.E. 2, worked on Thorn, an experimental sci-fi job simulator that came out exclusively in a Humble Bundle. &amp;quot;We want to explore that further.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact there may not be another Q.U.B.E. game makes this one feel even more special. Despite its narrative flaws, it&amp;apos;s a game that any puzzle fan should play, and the fact that nine years ago it was just an idea by three undergraduate students is testament to the power of the indie scene to reward original ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2365953485466362604</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 03:08:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Overkill's The Walking Dead dev diary explores apocalyptic Georgetown</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2365953485464558498</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overkill&amp;apos;s The Walking Dead, the upcoming four-player co-op zombie FPS, has released a developer diary showcasing the neighborhood of Georgetown in Washington D.C.. You can watch it above, as producer Saul Gascon and a few lighting and environmental artists describe what went into designing the look and feel of the town in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payday studio Overkill announced The Walking Dead back in 2014, with an original plan to release it in 2016, which was then pushed to 2017. It&amp;apos;s now due out in fall of this year.

&lt;p&gt;Cults in games have a long, proud tradition of getting to go full wackadoo. Mostly, they&amp;#8217;re a really nice device to lean on, especially in a game where you want to fill the world with collectibles and audio logs and you need some narrative to build that space. Also, they&amp;#8217;re pretty easy in that, if you don&amp;#8217;t give a flip about collectibles, you can generally parse that cults are evil and cultists deserve to die. &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the-knife-of-aristotle-isnt-just-a-fake-fake-news.html"&gt;I may have learned a few things about that the hard way this year&lt;/a&gt;. That said, &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/far-cry-5"&gt;Far Cry 5&lt;/a&gt; releases this week and focuses on a cult in America that uses religion and being pretty crap people in general to take over an entire state. In preparation, we look back at some of the wackier cults to be featured in games&amp;#8217; proud lineage of brainwashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our round-up of the best Metroidvania games. That slightly awkward portmanteau refers to a hybrid genre inspired by Metroid and Castlevania. They tend to be 2D platformers that have you exploring dungeons, defeating bosses, and picking up items that unlock new zones of the map. Within this simple format there is plenty of room for variation and, it turns out, lots of gorgeous art.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the games on the list have been lovingly crafted by small teams and even individuals over the course of a decade or so. Others, like Dead Cells, experiment with fusing the metroidvania with other genres to create a powerful hybrid. Whichever games you pick, expect lots of 2D platforming and some tough boss fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ori and the Blind Forest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/387290/Ori_and_the_Blind_Forest_Definitive_Edition/"&gt;Ori&amp;apos;s&lt;/a&gt; warmly animated world and slightly tearful opener barely hint at the incredibly tricky platforming challenges that follow. PC Gamer&amp;apos;s Philippa Warr has compared this to a teddy bear that wants to punch you in the face&amp;#x2014;it&amp;apos;s a cute and beautiful-looking game, but damn tricky. The pleasant soundtrack puts you at ease while the game rarely does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#xA0;Axiom Verge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the very best modern examples of the form, &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/332200/Axiom_Verge/"&gt;Axiom Verge&lt;/a&gt; is set in a dark, Giger-esque alien world populated by mysterious giant mechanical beings and, of course, a slew of bullet hell boss monsters. New paths open up as you discover fresh alien gadgetry, like a trenchcoat that lets you phase through walls, and a device that lets you control a small alien bug to crawl into new cave systems.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combat is simple&amp;#x2014;blast the alien things flapping around each level&amp;#x2014;but there are loads of weapons to discover, and plenty of secrets if you&amp;#x2019;re determined enough to glitch or blast your way through secret walls. It&amp;#x2019;s a sinister and slightly unnerving game with some genuinely dark moments, but that makes it a fitting tribute to the lonely hostile corridors of the original Metroid games.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hollow Knight&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one takes a while to get going, but once you have a few upgrades it&amp;#x2019;s a spectacular hand-drawn metroidvania with a snappy melee combat system. &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/"&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/a&gt; borrows its melancholy apocalyptic atmosphere from Dark Souls, and also its currency recovering system&amp;#x2014;if you make it back to the place you died you can reclaim your last life&amp;#x2019;s earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollow Knight looks gorgeous, and it&amp;#x2019;s full of interesting bug characters that sell you new gear and give you extra quests. The bosses are challenging and the dodge-and-slash combat is a serious test of skill once you&amp;#x2019;ve unlocked a few moves and started running into the game&amp;#x2019;s more serious enemies. The world is beautifully put together, too, and you learn more about the fate of the city as you dash, skip, and double-jump into new zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Owlboy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#x2019;ll notice that many of these games are set underground in endless cave systems. &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/115800/Owlboy/"&gt;Owlboy&lt;/a&gt; is set in a floating cloud kingdom. As said Owlboy, Otus, you have to flap around the world in a slightly cumbersome manner befitting a character who is regarded as an idiot by his village. You can teleport friends into your claws as you fly around. Different pals come with different abilities; some will fend off nearby enemies with projectile attacks, others will help you to access new zones in true metroidvania fashion. It&amp;#x2019;s tricky to say much about Owlboy without spoiling the story, but suffice to say it&amp;#x2019;s an emotional ride depicted in lovingly detailed pixel art.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shadow Complex Remastered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blast your way through a military compound with machine guns in this &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/385560/Shadow_Complex_Remastered/"&gt;futuristic Metroidvania&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#x2019;s billed as a &amp;#x201C;2.5D&amp;#x201D; game, which means you run and jump on a 2D plane, but can shoot into the background as soldiers and battle robots. You play as an ordinary man called Jason Fleming who gets lost on a hike and stumbles across a high-tech group bent on starting a civil war in the US. The game escalates from there you strap on their armour, raid their armoury and start blasting their mechs. The game was originally released on XBOX Live Arcade, but lives on Steam now as Shadow Complex Remastered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cave Story+&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daisuke Amaya&amp;#x2019;s seminal indie metroidvania is available on PC as &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/Cave_Story/"&gt;Cave Story+&lt;/a&gt;, which features the original 320x240 visuals and the updated version. You play an amnesiac boy who wakes up in a cave full of rabbit folk called Mimigas. They are being picked off by the malign creations of a mad scientist, who you need to chase across 15 levels. It&amp;#x2019;s a big game, especially considering it was made by one very dedicated creator with a clear love for the 16-bit era. An absolute classic and a must-play if you love metroidvanias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Iconoclasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From one solo creator to another. Joakim Sandberg spent many years painstakingly designing, animating and composing for &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/393520/Iconoclasts/"&gt;Iconoclasts&lt;/a&gt;. The result is a cheery and colourful metroidvania starring a friendly mechanic called Robin. This is a relatively shooty one featuring more than 20 bosses, but the worlds are packed with chatty characters. It&amp;#x2019;s worth picking up to see what seven years of one guy&amp;#x2019;s life&amp;#x2019;s work looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steamworld Dig 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approachable, and not too difficult, the &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/"&gt;Steamworld Dig&lt;/a&gt; games deliver a gentle hit of Metroidvania action supplemented by lots of Terraria-style digging. You can pickaxe your way through the levels, but this isn&amp;#x2019;t a sandbox. You have to tunnel your way to new zones and grab new gadgets to upgrade your hero, a steam-powered cowboy robot in the first game and a blue woman in flying goggles in the second. The sequel has more varied environments and a bigger world to explore, so that&amp;#x2019;s the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/"&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/a&gt; straddles the line between Metroidvania and roguelike, which makes it a warped child of Super Metroid, Castlevania and Rogue. You battle through randomised dungeons, starting from the beginning each time you die. As you chop up enemies in beautifully animated exchanges of sword-blows and bow attacks they drop cells that you can pour into your character.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This persistent element eventually gives your guy the sturdiness to reach new zones you haven&amp;#x2019;t seen before, fulfilling the typical metroidvania exploration pattern. Dead Cells is a game about blasting through dungeons as quickly and efficiently as possible. When you arrive in an area a timer starts on a hidden treasure door somewhere on the level, if you can find it before the timer expires, you get access to a room full of special items and sweet cash. Dead Cells is a high pressure game compared to others in this list (bar Ori and Hollow Knight), but if you like action and great pixel art Dead Cells is a good option, though it still has some time to mature in Early Access.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2365952982525814920</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:19:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Watch the Accolades Trailer for Q.U.B.E. 2 </title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2365952982525759202</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VIDEO: An interview with Lukas Kunce of Amanita Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s the week of the Game Developers Conference here in San Francisco, which means devs from all over the world are in town to show off their games, talk about how they&amp;apos;re made, and throw business cards at strangers.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, Lukas Kunce of Amanita Design, creators of point-and-click classics like Machinarium and the Samorost series, was kind enough to sit down with me away from business card firing range. We had a nice chat about their most recent game &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/chuchel-reivew/"&gt;Chuchel&lt;/a&gt;, what they&amp;apos;re working on now, and the future of adventure games.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also learned a bit about what the studio is working on now, including &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-creators-of-machinarium-and-chuchel-are-making-a-horror-game/"&gt;a horror game&lt;/a&gt; and another built of 3D scans of cardboard creations. For fans of fluff, we also discussed whether Chuchel will get the plushie treatment, what the hell the blockchain is, and brainstormed what an Amanita shooter would look like. (Hint: it won&amp;apos;t look like anything.)&lt;/p&gt;

If you can&amp;apos;t be convinced, you might fancy a complimentary trip to sunny Sapienza. &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-making-of-sapienza-hitmans-best-level/"&gt;Hitman&amp;apos;s best level&lt;/a&gt; is going free for a limited time.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the game&amp;apos;s Spring Pack, the free download extends from now through April 3 whereafter the Sapienza mission is yours to keep for good.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer IO Interactive explains that Elusive Targets have been reactivated too, and that the special offer also boasts 20 levels of Mastery (including weapon and item unlocks), over 100 challenges, and all of the Escalation Contracts, Challenge Packs and Featured Contracts specific to Episode 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information on all of that can be found &lt;a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-spring-pack/"&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;. And before you go, let me share this excerpt from Phil&amp;apos;s &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hitman-episode-2-review/"&gt;85-scoring Sapienza mission review&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sapienza&amp;apos;s freedom is an important distinction over Paris, but there&amp;apos;s another factor that makes it work so well. In The Showstopper mission, targets Viktor Novikov and Dalia Margolis host a fashion show and auction respectively. As such, they&amp;apos;re notable figures in a public space&amp;#x2014;on guard and suspicious.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In World of Tomorrow, your targets are living their lives. It&amp;apos;s not that they&amp;apos;re unprotected&amp;#x2014;their mansion is crawling with guards&amp;#x2014;but they aren&amp;apos;t suspecting anything out of the ordinary. That makes for a profound difference in how the levels play out. The challenge is less intricate, and that let&amp;apos;s 47 more naturalistically discover opportunities.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Hitman&amp;apos;s Spring Pack is free to download now through April 3.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2365952982525171682</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2018 13:14:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Play Sapienza for FREE!</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2365952982525116509</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for HITMAN™&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davey Wreden, creator of the The Stanley Parable and The Beginner&amp;apos;s Guide, discussed his current game design goals during an indie panel at GDC 2018 today. Wreden didn&amp;apos;t officially announce or nail down anything, but he did offer an intriguing glimpse at some of the ideas he&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;shooting for&amp;quot; and what we might see next from the eccentric designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ve been thinking a lot about why people continue playing a game after they&amp;apos;ve started, assuming it&amp;apos;s somewhat fun or interesting on a core mechanical level,&amp;quot; Wreden said. &amp;quot;Why does a person want to put in hour after after on this one game as opposed to playing a different game? What creates their engagement?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wreden grouped the reasons for this into three categories. Firstly, to become better or to optimize, &amp;quot;the enjoyable feeling that you are better now at the game than you were when you started playing.&amp;quot; Secondly, to make progress, &amp;quot;watching your number go up or gaining more items or more stuff.&amp;quot; And thirdly, to see more content, &amp;quot;we like the story, we like the characters, we like the world, and we want to continue to see more of it.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To me, these three things sum up what 99.9 percent of games are doing to engage players,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;And we know this is effective on some level and it can be a lot of fun. We all like games like this. The question I&amp;apos;ve been grappling with lately is, how could you make a game that is engaging, compelling and does not rely on any of these three things to make you interested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These three points all rely on something outside the act of play itself to be interesting. With the first, you&amp;apos;re imagining a future version of yourself who&amp;apos;s better at the game. With the second, you&amp;apos;re imagining a future where your number is bigger. With the third, you&amp;apos;re imagining how cool it will be to see the rest of the story. They&amp;apos;re all future-motivated. I would love to explore play that&amp;apos;s engaging and compelling in this very moment, without that reliance on the future.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The weird goal that I was setting for myself is to create a game that is intrinsically fun to play and has the kind of context that would make us say &amp;apos;this is a videogame,&amp;apos; but, at its core, does not rely on any of these three things to be compelling. I think they can still be there, but can they be something other than the sole direct reason why you want to continue playing?&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What would a game be like where you make interesting choices, but you can&amp;apos;t get better at making those choices, or you can&amp;apos;t make more optimized choices? What about a game where you&amp;apos;re growing or making progress in an interesting way, but where the outcomes are obscure enough that you can&amp;apos;t see what the outcomes will lead to? What about a game that has a story, but you don&amp;apos;t need to see every piece of content to get the story?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All of these sound counterintuitive, but that&amp;apos;s why I&amp;apos;m so excited. The bizarre, impossible-sounding goal I&amp;apos;ve set for myself is to create a game that does all of these things. I don&amp;apos;t have a good answer yet as to how exactly I&amp;apos;ll do that.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone can find a good answer to these wonky questions, it&amp;apos;s probably Wreden. The Stanley Parable scribbled all over narrative conventions, and The Beginner&amp;apos;s Guide was as much an intimate lecture on Wreden&amp;apos;s design process as it was a game. He&amp;apos;s made a name for himself by breaking the rules. It will be interesting to see if he can do it again and one-up his own auteurism.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2365952982523708416</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2018 03:26:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The creators of Machinarium and Chuchel are making a horror game</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2982945658370941694</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/b&gt; for Machinarium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find this eerie face on &lt;a href="http://www.jaromirplachy.net/games.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jarom  r Plach  's website&lt;/a&gt;, the only game project without a name or description.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a GDC interview with PC Gamer, Lukas Kunce of Amanita Design, creators of point-and-click classics like Machinarium and the slapstick comedy adventure Chuchel (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/chuchel-reivew/" target="_blank"&gt;which is a riot&lt;/a&gt;), confirmed that the studio is working on four new games, one of which is the studio&amp;apos;s first attempt at horror.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s the most games the studio has worked on at once, says Kunce. &amp;quot;We usually had one game going on at a moment, but now it&amp;apos;s four.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chatting about the musicians behind Amanita&amp;apos;s games, Kunce gave us a few hints about what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's like Chuchel is a full out burst of comedy, this is a full out burst of disturbing things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lukas Kunce, Amanita Design&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right now, Floex is not working on anything, but he&amp;apos;s probably going to start working pretty soon on one of the four secret projects, and DVA are working on another from Jarom&amp;#xED;r Plach&amp;#xFD;, who just finished Chuchel,&amp;quot; says Kunce. &amp;quot;And he&amp;apos;s already almost finished another game.&amp;quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarom&amp;#xED;r Plach&amp;#xFD; is better known putting his creative energy into some of Amanita&amp;apos;s more buoyant, pleasant games, but if he can do scary as well as he does cute, then we&amp;apos;re in for some prime spooks.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s going to be a horror game, actually. Yeah, I&amp;apos;ve already played a bit and it&amp;apos;s so disturbing,&amp;quot; Kunce tells us. &amp;quot;Yeah, it&amp;apos;s like Chuchel is a full out burst of comedy, this is a full out burst of disturbing things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should know more by the end of the year, but Kunce didn&amp;apos;t want to make any promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horror game will probably be whatever the opposite of this is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked if Amanita was always going to stick to 2D design, Kunce dropped a few details about one of the other three games in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well one of the games is played from the 2D perspective, but it&amp;apos;s actually made in 3D, so we can probably say we&amp;apos;re not 2D anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continues, &amp;quot;All of the assets and all of the buildings in the game and characters are made from actual cardboard and painted and stuff. And then they&amp;apos;re scanning it into Unity and kind of animating it and post-processing it. It&amp;apos;s got a super unique look.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;apos;ll be able to listen to our complete conversation soon, in which we ask what an Amanita shooter would look like, whether Chuchel will get the plushie treatment, and what the hell the blockchain is.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2982945658370941694</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 22:25:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>HDR for PC games is a hot mess (but it s nice when it works)</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/rps/2982945658370293450</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/b&gt; for HITMAN™&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the things I have had to do in order to get a workable version of HDR (also known as high dynamic range), the new-ish display technology that significantly ramps up brightness, darkness and vibrancy, on my PC (not including the acquisition of a fancy monitor):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Try four different display cables&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Adjust as many as seven different brightness/contrast/colour etc shaders &lt;em&gt;per game&lt;/em&gt;. (I have spent long, unhappy hours doing this to date)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Manually turn on HDR on the monitor, manually turn HDR on in Windows then manually turn on HDR in the game settings. Or sometimes HDR off in Windows but on in the game then alt-tab back to Windows and turn HDR on, and off, and on, and off. Or sometimes alt-tab and alt-tab and alt-tab and alt-tab and alt-tab until HDR suddenly, randomly kicks in. When I exit the game, I have to manually turn it all back off again or Windows is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Install an unfinished preview build of Windows 10 whose HDR isn&amp;#8217;t totally broken on Nvidia cards.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Almost completely lose my sense of whether anything is actually different after all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survival horror, simulation, strategy, FPS, and many more genres feature in this, our roundup of the best space games you can play on PC right now. Whether you&amp;apos;re hunting pirates, building a colony on Mars, or fleeing in terror from a hungry alien on a stricken space station, these galactic games will appeal to anyone who&amp;apos;s ever dreamed of leaving boring old Earth behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
One of the best singleplayer RTS campaigns ever made, and beautifully remastered by Gearbox. The sight of thousands of your ships streaking across the game&amp;#x2019;s vividly colourful space-scapes is hugely dramatic. And battles are tense and tactical, with many types of ship to command, including colossal battleships. The Remastered Collection looks great on modern PCs and comes complete with the original Homeworld and its sequel.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Leaving Earth behind, humanity heads to Mars to start a new colony: and you&amp;apos;re in charge of it. Your new civilisation will grow from one small dome in the Martian desert to a bustling, sprawling off-world metropolis. But just make sure you don&amp;apos;t run out of oxygen or power, because on this ruthless planet it&amp;apos;s a death sentence for every citizen under your control.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The crew has mysteriously abandoned the Tacoma lunar transfer station, and you&amp;#x2019;ve been sent to investigate and recover its precious AI, Odin. This atmospheric sci-fi mystery from the makers of Gone Home is wonderfully written, with a cast of rich, nuanced characters telling a compelling story through interactive AR recordings. Exploring the hyper-detailed station is a delight thanks to the game&amp;#x2019;s extraordinary attention to detail, and the more you learn about Tacoma, the deeper the mystery gets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
An entire galaxy is your playground in this space sim. Starting with a basic ship and a handful of credits, you shape your own destiny. Do you become a fearsome pirate? A master trader? An explorer? The beauty of Elite is being able to play in a way that suits you. From thrilling dogfights to gentle exploration, there&amp;#x2019;s something for everyone. And its ships are all an absolute dream to fly, whether it&amp;apos;s a nimble fighter or a heavy duty cargo hauler.&lt;br&gt;

Live another life&amp;#x2014;in space! There&amp;#x2019;s nothing else like EVE Online on PC, a massively multiplayer RPG where everything is controlled by players. It&amp;#x2019;s a living galaxy in which thousands of capsuleers fight, trade, mine, and explore together. Break away from the relative safety of your police-patrolled starting system and you&amp;#x2019;ll find a ruthless, cosmic Wild West, where piracy, espionage and scamming are rife. Whether you&amp;#x2019;re fighting in a massive space war, where thousands of real-world dollars hang in the balance, or just exploring New Eden on your own, EVE is an unforgettable experience.&lt;br&gt;

When you die in roguelike Everspace, you&amp;#x2019;re dead. But money earned carries over and can be spent on upgrades, which means you&amp;#x2019;ll be more powerful for your next run through the cosmic gauntlet. And these perks keep adding up, allowing you to travel deeper into space, and more boldly, with every successive attempt. It&amp;#x2019;s a compelling loop, and when you die you&amp;apos;re never frustrated: just excited to start again, wondering how far you&amp;apos;ll make it this time.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Developed by Petroglyph, a studio founded by Westwood veterans, this real-time strategy is one of the best Star Wars games on PC. The streamlined interface and accessible systems might turn off some hardcore strategy fans, but in the thick of its chaotic, thrilling land and space battles the game is irresistible&amp;#x2014;especially if you&amp;#x2019;re a Star Wars fan. And hero units like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker only add to the excitement.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
In this top-down sci-fi action game you board spaceships and use an array of weapons and gadgets to take out the crew. The genius lies in how much creativity you&amp;apos;re given to play your own way, inspired by the best immersive sims. And how you react to the chaos that erupts when your presence on the ship becomes known makes Heat Signature a powerful anecdote generator. Things might not always go to plan, but that&amp;apos;s just part of the fun.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Despite being viewed entirely through a retro-futuristic computer interface, Duskers is one of the scariest, most tense sci-fi horror games on PC. In it you pilot a fleet of drones searching derelict spaceships for fuel, upgrades, and clues about why the galaxy is so mysteriously devoid of life. The ships you board are crawling with strange creatures, which makes looking for clues in those narrow, dark corridors an especially nerve-racking experience.&lt;br&gt;

Bungie&amp;apos;s addictive FPS/MMO hybrid features some of the prettiest alien landscapes on PC. From the forested ruins of Earth and the vast seas of Titan, to the red jungles of Nessus and the volcanic Io, every location is a pleasure to loot-and-shoot in. The endgame doesn&amp;apos;t have the iron grip it perhaps should, but sci-fi fans will get a kick out of this vivid, colourful setting.&lt;br&gt;

A mission to divert an asteroid heading for Earth goes awry, sending a group of astronauts to a distant, seemingly abandoned world. Some of the puzzles are maddeningly obscure, even for a LucasArts point-and-click adventure, but the colourful, bizarre planet feels genuinely alien. Great voice acting too, with X-Files star Robert Patrick playing the lead character.&lt;br&gt;

This space simulator lets you become an all-powerful cosmic deity, manipulating replicas of real galaxies and solar systems and witnessing the (often catastrophic) results of your meddling.

Stranded alone somewhere near Jupiter on an old luxury starship, your only hope of returning home is an AI that has serious emotional problems. You interact with Kaizen using your keyboard, and sometimes it&amp;apos;ll be willing to help you. But then it&amp;apos;ll change its mind and decide the best thing to do is close the airlock and trap you outside the ship until you run out of air. A clever adventure with the understated mood of a &amp;apos;70s sci-fi film.&lt;br&gt;

If you&amp;#x2019;ve ever fantasised about being Captain Picard, in command of your own starship, exploring the galaxy, meeting weird aliens, being confronted with cosmic dilemmas, then Mass Effect 2 is that in game form. It&amp;#x2019;s part Star Wars space opera, part brilliant Star Trek episode, and one of the best sci-fi games on PC. It doesn&amp;#x2019;t have the freedom of Elite and is largely a linear experience, but it takes you on an unforgettable journey around the galaxy, visiting bizarre planets and getting involved in the lives of the aliens who live on them. We love the whole series, but we all agree that this is our favourite.&lt;br&gt;

Developed by Paradox, of Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis fame, this sci-fi epic puts the &amp;#x2018;grand&amp;#x2019; in grand strategy. Explore the universe, form alliances with alien factions, and engage in the odd large-scale space battle. The multitude of systems makes Stellaris a powerful story generator, and you never know what strange beings you&amp;#x2019;ll meet among the stars.&lt;br&gt;

Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen, is hunted through a dilapidated space station by a xenomorph in this incredible survival horror. Taking its cues from Ridley Scott&amp;apos;s original 1979 film, it&amp;apos;s a masterpiece of slow-burning tension. And the station itself, Sevastopol, is a great example of lo-fi sci-fi, with chunky retro-futuristic tech and eerie flickering lights. One of the most faithful movie adaptations ever, and a great horror game in its own right.&lt;br&gt;

This is one of the most dazzlingly colourful sci-fi universes on PC, and being able to seamlessly transition from space to the surface of a planet is an impressive technical feat. The addition of features like base-building and a mission system in recent updates give you a lot more to actually do when you touch down on these worlds, and the procedural generation algorithm has been tweaked to make for weirder, prettier planet surfaces.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year &lt;/strong&gt;2012&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
FTL mixes turn-based and real-time strategy together to capture the experience of captaining a Star Trek-style spacecraft. It&amp;#x2019;s a strong roguelike, too, with a backdrop of a familiar yet fun sci-fi universe that comes with its own semi-humorous lore and a neat set of narrative beats that make the journey to its finale endlessly exciting. Being able to name your ship and crew makes it all the more heartbreaking when they die together in enemy space.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wing Commander: Privateer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Link &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gog.com/game/wing_commander_privateer" target="_blank"&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fans of the series will argue endlessly about which Wing Commander is the best, but we love Privateer&amp;#x2019;s darker feel. It&amp;#x2019;s a rich sandbox in which you can be a mercenary, a pirate, a merchant, or a mix of all three. You jump between systems looking for bounties to hunt and ships to rob, and the first-person dogfights are a thrill. There&amp;#x2019;s a linear story, but the real joy lies in doing your own thing and carving your own path through the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#xA0;EVE: Valkyrie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If you have a VR headset, this is the game to play on it. In Valkyrie you get to experience EVE Online&amp;#x2019;s famous space battles from the more intimate perspective of an individual fighter pilot. The feeling of being strapped into a cockpit, hurtling through space at immense speeds, is a visceral one. And the combat has been tuned specifically for virtual reality.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Wrestle with gravity and the laws of physics as you build your own spacecraft and attempt to explore the cosmos. A robust, compelling sandbox of possibilities that&amp;#x2019;s as funny as it is clever. Escaping Kerbin&amp;#x2019;s atmosphere and landing on the Mun (without exploding) for the first time with a ship you&amp;#x2019;ve built yourself is about as satisfying as PC gaming gets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If you like your space games a little more grounded, try Arma developer Bohemia&amp;#x2019;s Take On Mars. It&amp;#x2019;s a space exploration and colonisation simulator largely based on real astro-science. You can build a Curiosity-style rover and explore the surface of the red planet or construct your own Martian colony. A game for folk who want the sci without too much of the fi.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Mixing real-time strategy with 4X elements, Sins is a game of galactic conquest. Choose a faction, gather resources and become a mighty space-lord. Commanding its real-time wars is thrilling, but combat isn&amp;#x2019;t always the answer: you can use diplomacy to conquer systems too. A refreshingly slow-paced RTS with some truly massive space battles to stare slack-jawed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Space Engineers&lt;/h3&gt;

You can hover around the map with a jetpack or build a gravity generator to walk safely on the surface of bigger asteroids. One of the best co-op build-&amp;#x2019;em-ups on PC.&lt;br&gt;

Terraria-esque survival with a science fiction twist. Hop between randomly generated planets on a starship, hunt alien creatures for food, build colonies and underground bases, and try not to die in the process. A brilliant sci-fi sandbox with a charming art style. Playable races include robots, beings made of solar energy, ape-like creatures, and colourful wingless birds.&lt;br&gt;

Then play SpaceEngine, which features, incredibly, the entire universe. Or at least the bit we know about. Focus on Earth, then pull back at top speed, and you suddenly become aware of how you&amp;#x2019;re on a tiny speck of dust hurtling through an endless void. The tech is remarkable, allowing you to travel effortlessly between galaxies and land on planets. But besides exploring, there isn&amp;#x2019;t much else to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2095718613784630851</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:37:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>March Map Jam - The Protagonist Dies at the End</title><link>http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2982945658361759358</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via &lt;b&gt;Community Announcements&lt;/b&gt; for Overgrowth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/pure-farming"&gt;Pure Farming&lt;/a&gt; 2018 is out now. Farming Sim games now come from several competitive developers but also that competition leaves me confused because most entries in the Farm Gaming World seem interchangeable. I&amp;#8217;m missing a key element in what draws people in, but this genre keeps raking in money hand over fist, so the problem must be with me. Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at what Pure Farming 2018 is bringing to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Whoops, I got a bit carried away in writing this game up the first time. I have some frustrations with the genre and it got a bit out of hand. Sorry to any digital farmers whom may have been offended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, snap! It&amp;apos;s yet another &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/pcg-qa/" target="_blank"&gt;PCG Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, where every Saturday we ask the panel of PC Gamer writers a question about PC gaming. You&amp;apos;re also very welcome to share your thoughts in the comments below. This week: &lt;strong&gt;which game actually lived up to the hype?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jody Macgregor: The Witcher 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated the first Witcher game, and although the second one&amp;apos;s an improvement in a lot of ways I still thought most of it was dull&amp;#x2014;apart from the bit where you get drunk and wake up with a tattoo, obviously. So when glowing reviews came out for The Witcher 3 I ignored them. There was plenty of other stuff to play in 2015: Tales From the Borderlands, Rocket League, Life is Strange, Pillars of Eternity, Devil Daggers, Her Story. I was busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a solid year&amp;apos;s worth of articles about how incredible every aspect of The Witcher 3 was, from the side quests to the potion-making to the characters to the wind in the goddamn trees, before I finally caved and tried it. Everyone was right, it&amp;apos;s now on my &amp;quot;best games of all time&amp;quot; list, and I&amp;apos;ve become one of those people who says you should turn the music down so you can hear the wind in Velen. There&amp;apos;s an entire subreddit devoted to whinging about games journalism&amp;apos;s never-ending love affair with writing about The Witcher 3, but without that constant praise I wouldn&amp;apos;t have pushed past my disinterest to give it the chance it deserved. And now I&amp;apos;ve become one of those people who won&amp;apos;t shut up about The Witcher 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samuel Roberts: Metal Gear Solid V&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will agree with this one, but I&amp;apos;ve lived through multiple Metal Gear hype cycles (MGS2 and MGS4 most memorably), and this is the one game that really deserved it. While this Metal Gear has the worst story in the series by far, it&amp;apos;s also a superior stealth game. With its suite of upgrades and repeatable missions, I easily played MGSV for over 100 hours, and I have no doubt I&amp;apos;ll reinstall it someday.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chris Livingston: Portal 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the original Portal was a near-perfect experience. You learned to play as you played and each test chamber increased in complexity at a rate that was challenging but never frustrating. It was funny and surprising and satisfying, and short enough that it didn&amp;apos;t have time to wear out its welcome. When trailers for Portal 2 began appearing, I was just as excited as anyone else, though I wasn&amp;apos;t really expecting to love it in the same way. More complex, more characters, more story, more puzzles, more more more. I just couldn&amp;apos;t imagine it matching the original, which proved (to me at least) that less is more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It definitely lived up to the hype, though. Portal 2 is amazing, funny, challenging, surprising, and every bit as brilliant as the first. Maybe it&amp;apos;s still true that less is more, but that doesn&amp;apos;t mean more is less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jarred Walton: Half-Life 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piggybacking off Chris here, Half-Life 2 was an incredible follow-up to one of the best (if not the best) games of the &amp;apos;90s. The original Half-Life surprised the hell out of me with ways it changed the first-person shooter. After playing a ton of Quake and Quake 2, story seemed to be an afterthought, but Half-Life revolutionized the genre. Okay, the Xen levels at the end almost ruined it, but I still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I waited, waited, and waited some more. Daikatana proved that games too long in development could suck, and HL2 felt like it might be doomed to the same fate. But with the addition of the gravity gun and physics, plus a great setting and story that made you care about the characters, it exceeded its source material in every way. I&amp;apos;m still holding out hope for HL3, naturally, but those are some massive shoes to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tom Senior: Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dangerously excited when a new Deus Ex was announced. I was hyped to the extent that it would have really stung if a new Deus Ex fell well short of expectations. Human Revolution had a few problems, but it was exactly the atmospheric cyberpunk playground I wanted and the art direction added a new dimension to the Deus Ex universe. Due to the technological limitations of the era the old Deus Ex games struggled to show art or architecture (apart from that silly Earth-in-a-giant-claw statue at the start). Human Revolution decided that everything would be gold, and full of triangles, and its depiction of futuristic augments was gorgeous. I would quite like a pair of Jensen arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human Revolution really got Deus Ex. It had hacking, vents, and intricate levels. But it also had something else, something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;: retractable arm-swords. Not many people would look at the groundbreaking masterpiece of Deus Ex and think &amp;apos;this needs retractable arm-swords&amp;apos;, but Eidos Montreal had the vision to make retractable arm-swords happen. I will always respect them for that.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Andy Kelly: Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the buzz around Vice City vividly. Every time I saw that stylish advert on TV, the one with &amp;apos;I Ran&amp;apos; by Flock of Seagulls, I got a tingle of excitement. Magazines were full of gushing previews, treating every morsel of information like it was the biggest scoop since Watergate. And then when it came out, it was everything I dreamed it would be. A bigger, more detailed city. An incredible soundtrack. More fun and varied missions. A better story. An all-star cast. HELICOPTERS. Being able to fly around a city of that size back then was a genuine thrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GTA III was great, but it felt like an experiment in places; a concept for what a 3D Grand Theft Auto game could be. But Vice City was the first time Rockstar really nailed it, and laid a solid foundation for the 3D era of their world-conquering series. The &amp;apos;80s (or at least some exaggerated, romanticised version of it) has begun to saturate pop culture to an annoying degree lately, so I can&amp;apos;t see Rockstar returning to that setting. It&amp;apos;s too obvious. But I would like to see Vice City again in a different, more contemporary era, perhaps showing the bleak, faded aftermath of its hedonistic &amp;apos;80s heyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Andy Chalk: Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I saw &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjhkpTWIBuA" target="_blank"&gt;this teaser&lt;/a&gt; I made a noise like a ten-year-old opening the latest issue of Tiger Beat. Then I saw &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoRwOux7Ofw" target="_blank"&gt;this teaser&lt;/a&gt;, and I pretty much hyperventilated and passed out. I knew in my heart that DX: Human Revolution couldn&amp;apos;t be that good, because Deus Ex was lightning in a bottle: Ugly, clunky, with terrible voice acting and a ridiculous, incoherent story, all of which somehow got smushed together into basically the best game ever made. How do you fall down a flight of stairs and land in a bed of roses twice?&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Human Revolution came out, and it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; that good. Not perfect, and I will never not be mad about those boss fights. But Adam Jensen is the perfect successor (predecessor, I suppose) to JC Denton, I loved the visual style (including the piss filter) and the music (because it&amp;apos;s not Deus Ex without a great soundtrack), and the whole thing just felt right: Not as off-the-conspiracy-theory-hook as the original, but big and sprawling and unpredictable&amp;#x2014;a legitimate point of entry into that world. It took more than a decade to get from Deus Ex to Human Revolution, and it was worth the wait.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><guid>2982945658358101644</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 09:09:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
